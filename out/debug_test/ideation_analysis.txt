Each of the `\input` commands would lead to separate `.tex` files corresponding to each section of the paper. The Python code for the algorithm and any simulations would be included in the 'methodology' and 'experimental setup' sections, respectively. The 'results' section would include placeholders for the actual simulation outputs, which would be added later.
