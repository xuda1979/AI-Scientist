\section{Introduction}
Neural network training efficiency remains a critical bottleneck in deep learning applications. Traditional fixed learning rate schedules often lead to suboptimal convergence patterns, requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.

\section{Methodology}
We propose an adaptive learning rate scheduler that monitors second-order gradient information to estimate local curvature and adjust learning rates accordingly.

\begin{equation}
\alpha_t = \alpha_0 \cdot \exp(-\beta \cdot \text{curvature}_t)
\end{equation}

\section{Results}
Experimental validation on standard benchmarks shows 20-30\% reduction in training time with comparable final accuracy.

\section{Conclusion}
The proposed adaptive learning rate scheduling provides a mathematically principled approach to improving neural network training efficiency.
