# OpenAI OSS 120B Model

This directory is intended to contain the vendored source code for the OpenAI open-source 120B parameter model. Due to its size,
the full model weights and implementation are not included here. Obtain the official release from OpenAI and place the code and
weights within this directory following the structure expected by `utils.oss120b.load_model`.
