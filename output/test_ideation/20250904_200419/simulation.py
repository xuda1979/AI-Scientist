# Multi-Fidelity Training with Learned Surrogate Gradients for Hybrid Models
# Deterministic, single-file implementation with experiment orchestration and
# result logging. The algorithm alternates between a fast simulator and a
# hardware oracle (emulated) while learning a surrogate correction whose
# gradient is used under a trust-region schedule.
