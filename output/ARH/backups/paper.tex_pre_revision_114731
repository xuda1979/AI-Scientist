\title{Adaptive Resonance Hierarchies (ARH): \\ A Framework for Dynamic Structural Learning}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The pursuit of artificial general intelligence necessitates models that can autonomously adapt their internal \emph{structure} in response to non-stationary environments. Prevailing deep learning architectures rely on fixed hierarchies, rendering them brittle when faced with novel abstractions that require new reasoning pathways. This leads to catastrophic forgetting or an inability to learn. We introduce the \textbf{Adaptive Resonance Hierarchy (ARH)}, a neural framework that grows and reorganizes its own reasoning hierarchy during inference. Inspired by principles from Predictive Coding (PC) and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), ARH operates by testing top-down predictions against bottom-up evidence. A sufficient match (a state of \emph{resonance}) permits learning, while persistent mismatch (\emph{dissonance}) triggers structural adaptation. The core of the architecture is the \emph{Gated Resonant Unit} (GRU-R), a recurrent unit that couples temporal sequence processing with a vigilance-gated plasticity mechanism. The hierarchy adapts via two primary mechanisms: \emph{Horizontal Expansion} (recruiting new nodes for new patterns) and \emph{Vertical Expansion} (spawning new layers for new abstractions). The latter is driven by a process we term \emph{Spatio-Temporal Dissonance Consolidation} (STDC). We formalize the ARH framework, derive theoretical guarantees for its stability and growth, and present illustrative results from a principled simulation of a challenging hierarchical concept-drift benchmark. In this simulation, we model ARH's theoretical behavior, which demonstrates significantly faster adaptation than static baselines.

\section{Introduction}
Modern large-scale neural networks, including Transformers \citep{Vaswani2017} and widely used fixed hierarchical models such as capsule or modular networks \citep{Sabour2017,Andreas2016}, have achieved remarkable success on a wide range of tasks. However, their architectural rigidity is a critical limitation. Once trained, their structure is frozen, making them vulnerable in dynamic environments where the underlying concepts or their relationships change over time. When faced with a structural shift requiring fundamentally new abstractions, these models often fail, exhibiting catastrophic forgetting or an inability to incorporate new knowledge. This challenge lies at the heart of the stability–plasticity dilemma \citep{Grossberg1987}: how can a system be plastic enough to learn new information without unstably overwriting previously acquired knowledge?

Biological systems offer an elegant solution: they dynamically reorganize their internal models of the world in response to surprise or prediction error \citep{Piaget1954}. Inspired by this principle, we propose the \textbf{Adaptive Resonance Hierarchy (ARH)}, a framework that learns not only its parameters but also its own structure. ARH operationalizes this idea by synthesizing principles from two powerful theoretical concepts: Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) \citep{Grossberg1987} and Predictive Coding (PC) \citep{Rao1999}. The influence of ART is explicit in the model's core loop: a vigilance parameter sets a threshold for a match between expectation and reality, and only a "resonant" state permits learning. The framework is inspired by PC in that each level of the hierarchy attempts to predict the activity of the level below it. A successful prediction stabilizes existing knowledge, while a persistent failure to predict the input signal generates \emph{dissonance}, which drives structural adaptation to create new representations. See also complementary perspectives on biologically plausible error signaling \citep{Whittington2019}.

Our primary contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{A Formal ARH Framework:} We present a complete model that integrates PC and ART principles into a differentiable architecture, featuring a vigilance gate and well-defined dissonance dynamics for structural change.
    \item \textbf{The Gated Resonant Unit (GRU-R):} We introduce a novel recurrent unit that combines the temporal processing power of a GRU \citep{Cho2014} with a resonance-gated plasticity mechanism, ensuring that learning only occurs when predictions match evidence.
    \item \textbf{Spatio-Temporal Dissonance Consolidation (STDC):} We propose a concrete mechanism that transforms accumulated dissonance into new hierarchical layers by clustering buffered activation trajectories that consistently failed to resonate.
    \item \textbf{Theoretical Guarantees:} We provide formal results on (i) the stability of learned weights under non-resonant conditions, and (ii) a closed-form bound on the expected time-to-spawn a new layer under persistent mismatch, enabling principled parameterization.
    \item \textbf{Illustrative Validation:} We demonstrate the theoretical advantages of ARH in a principled, stylized simulation of a Hierarchical Concept Drift (HCD) benchmark. We model its expected behavior to show how it can outperform static baselines in recovery speed and adaptation. We also provide a full complexity analysis, a policy for budgeted growth, and sensitivity studies.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Predictive Coding and Hierarchical Models.} The idea that the brain is a prediction machine is central to PC \citep{Rao1999}. Complementary modern treatments explore links to learning rules in cortex \citep{Whittington2019}. Modular and hierarchical networks with fixed depth (e.g., capsule networks \citep{Sabour2017} and neural module networks \citep{Andreas2016}) demonstrate the importance of structure but remain static after training. ARH extends this by allowing the hierarchy itself to form dynamically based on prediction failure.

\paragraph{Continual Learning.} Most continual learning methods focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting within a \emph{fixed architecture}. This includes weight-regularization methods like EWC \citep{Kirkpatrick2017} and SI \citep{Zenke2017}, and replay-based methods like GEM \citep{LopezPaz2017}. While effective for parameter adaptation, they cannot address structural deficits. Reviews such as \citep{Parisi2019} summarize a spectrum of CL approaches. Related to our resonance-gated plasticity, learned plasticity rules such as Differentiable Plasticity \citep{Miconi2018} modulate synaptic change; ARH complements this line by gating plasticity with a global resonance signal and coupling it to structural growth.

\paragraph{Dynamic Architectures and NAS.} Several works have explored dynamic capacity. Progressive Nets \citep{Rusu2016} add new columns per task. Dynamically Expandable Networks (DEN) \citep{Yoon2018} selectively retrain and expand at task boundaries. Net2Net provides function-preserving network morphisms \citep{Chen2016}, and neural architecture search (NAS) automates structural design \citep{Zoph2017}. Differentiable NAS (e.g., DARTS \citep{Liu2019}) optimizes architecture parameters end-to-end. ARH is distinct in two ways: (1) its growth is driven by online, inference-time mismatch rather than offline task boundaries or separate search procedures, and (2) it specifically focuses on \emph{hierarchical depth} as the primary axis of growth to build more abstract representations.

\paragraph{Mixture of Experts (MoE).} Sparse expert routing scales compute \citep{Shazeer2017, Fedus2022}. This adapts the computational \emph{path} but not the underlying hierarchical \emph{structure}. ARH, in contrast, adapts the hierarchical depth itself.

\paragraph{Large Language Models.} Transformers \citep{Vaswani2017} have become the dominant backbone for LLMs (e.g., \citep{Brown2020}), but their architectural depth is static post-training; ARH focuses on depth that grows during inference to handle unmodeled abstractions.

\section{Preliminaries and Notation}
An ARH consists of a dynamically growing set of layers, indexed $i=0, \dots, K(t)$, where $K(t)$ is the depth at time $t$. Layer $L_0$ represents the input stream. Each layer $L_i$ for $i>0$ is composed of a set of Gated Resonant Units (GRU-R), denoted $\{N_j^i\}$, each with a hidden state $h_j^i(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}$. The input to layer $L_i$ at time $t$ is the winning hidden state from the layer below, $I_i(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i-1}}$.

\paragraph{Recognition and Generation.} Each node $N_j^i$ has bottom-up (recognition) and top-down (generation) weights, $W_j^{BU}$ and $W_j^{TD}$. We use linear transformations for simplicity, though more complex functions are compatible:
\begin{align}
    f_{\text{recog}}(h, W_j^{BU}) &\coloneqq W_j^{BU} h \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i-1}}, \\
    f_{\text{gen}}(h, W_j^{TD}) &\coloneqq W_j^{TD} h \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{i-1}}.
\end{align}

\paragraph{Node Activation and Winner Selection.} Node activation is determined by the cosine similarity between the input from the layer below and the node's recognition projection from its previous hidden state:
\begin{equation}
    A(N_j^i, t) \coloneqq \simop\big(I_i(t), f_{\text{recog}}(h_j^i(t-1), W_j^{BU})\big),
\end{equation}
where $\simop(x,y) \coloneqq \frac{x^\top y}{\|x\|\|y\|}$. A winner-take-all (WTA) or top-$k$ mechanism selects a candidate node $N_{\text{win}}^i$. The winner updates its hidden state using its standard GRU dynamics, driven by its activation value:
\begin{equation}
    h_{\text{win}}^i(t) = \text{GRU}\big(A(N_{\text{win}}^i, t), h_{\text{win}}^i(t-1)\big).
\end{equation}
This updated state is then used to generate a top-down prediction of the input:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{I}_i(t) = f_{\text{gen}}\big(h_{\text{win}}^i(t), W_{\text{win}}^{TD}\big).
\end{equation}
Cosine similarity stabilizes candidate selection under varying input scales and aligns naturally with the vigilance thresholding used for resonance.

\paragraph{Match, Vigilance, and Resonance.} The quality of the prediction is quantified by a match function $M$. We define it based on the squared reconstruction error $E_i(t) = \|I_i(t) - \hat{I}_i(t)\|_2^2$:
\begin{equation}
    M_{\text{win}}(t) \coloneqq \exp\big(-E_i(t) / \sigma_i^2\big),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_i^2$ is a scaling hyperparameter. Each layer $L_i$ has a vigilance parameter $\rho_i \in (0, 1)$. Resonance occurs if the match meets the vigilance threshold. We define both a hard and a soft (differentiable) resonance gate:
\begin{equation}
    R_i(t) \coloneqq \mathbb{I}[M_{\text{win}}(t) \ge \rho_i], \qquad
    \tilde{R}_i(t) \coloneqq \text{sigmoid}\big(\kappa(M_{\text{win}}(t) - \rho_i)\big),
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ is a sharpness parameter. For backpropagation, we use the soft gate $\tilde{R}_i(t)$ but apply a straight-through estimator (STE) for the hard gate $R_i(t)$. The STE passes the gradient of $\tilde{R}_i(t)$ unmodified, but only if $R_i(t)=1$, effectively blocking gradients through non-resonant states.

\paragraph{Dissonance Accumulator.} Each layer $L_i$ maintains a dissonance level $D_i(t)$, which integrates prediction failures over time:
\begin{equation}
    D_i(t) = (1 - \gamma_i) D_i(t-1) + \beta_i (1 - R_i(t)),
    \label{eq:dissonance}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_i \in (0,1)$ is a decay rate and $\beta_i \in (0,1)$ is an accumulation rate. Vertical expansion is triggered when $D_i(t)$ exceeds a threshold $\theta_{\text{spawn},i}$.

\section{Methods}
This section contextualizes the ARH mechanisms and adaptation cycle as the core methodological contribution, and it ties the formalization and algorithms to the simulation and evaluation design that follow.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Architecture: ARH layers implement predictive coding interactions (top-down generation; bottom-up matching) with ART-like vigilance gating. GRU-R units provide temporal modeling while their plasticity is gated by resonance.
    \item Learning: Weight updates are permitted only under resonance, ensuring stability for unexplainable inputs (Proposition below).
    \item Growth: Horizontal expansion creates new nodes within a layer for novel patterns. Vertical expansion (STDC) spawns new layers by consolidating buffered dissonant trajectories into prototypes that seed recognition weights.
    \item Theory-to-Simulation link: The dissonance dynamics in Eq.~\eqref{eq:dissonance} and the closed-form expectation in Theorem~\ref{thm:spawn_time} drive the principled simulation of concept drift in our evaluation.
\end{itemize}

\section{ARH: Mechanism and Adaptation}

\subsection{The Gated Resonant Unit (GRU-R) and Gated Plasticity}
The GRU-R is the fundamental building block of ARH. It is a standard GRU \citep{Cho2014} augmented with recognition and generation heads, and critically, a resonance gate $R_i(t)$. This gate controls two functions: (1) it enables or disables learning (plasticity), and (2) it determines whether the node's updated hidden state $h_{\text{win}}^i(t)$ is propagated as input to the next layer, $L_{i+1}$.

Weight updates are gated by the resonance signal, shielding the network from learning on noisy or unmodellable data. Let $\mathcal{W}_{\text{win}}$ be the weights (GRU and heads) of the winning node. The update rule for the learning objective (minimizing reconstruction error $E_i$) is:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \mathcal{W}_{\text{win}}(t) = R_i(t) \cdot \left(-\alpha \frac{\partial E_i(t)}{\partial \mathcal{W}_{\text{win}}}\right).
\end{equation}
This simple gating has a profound consequence for stability.

\begin{proposition}[Stability under Non-Resonance]
If an input stream causes a layer $L_i$ to be in a state of non-resonance ($R_i(t)=0$) for all $t$ in a given interval, then the weights $\mathcal{W}$ of all nodes in that layer remain constant throughout that interval. Consequently, inputs that the system cannot yet explain do not corrupt existing, stable memories.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Follows directly from the update rule, as $\Delta\mathcal{W}(t)=0$ when $R_i(t)=0$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Predictive Resonance Cycle}
At each time step, the ARH engages in a hierarchical predictive cycle:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Bottom-Up Pass:} An input $I_i(t)$ from layer $L_{i-1}$ is received by layer $L_i$. All nodes in $L_i$ compute their activation scores $A(N_j^i, t)$.
    \item \textbf{Winner Selection:} A candidate node $N_{\text{win}}^i$ is selected (e.g., via WTA or top-$k$ shortlist).
    \item \textbf{Top-Down Prediction:} The winner updates its hidden state $h_{\text{win}}^i(t)$ and generates a prediction $\hat{I}_i(t)$.
    \item \textbf{Vigilance Test:} The match $M_{\text{win}}(t)$ is compared against the vigilance parameter $\rho_i$.
    \item \textbf{Outcome:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If $M_{\text{win}}(t) \ge \rho_i$ (\textbf{Resonance}): Learning is enabled for $N_{\text{win}}^i$. Its hidden state $h_{\text{win}}^i(t)$ becomes the input $I_{i+1}(t)$ for the next layer, $L_{i+1}$. The cycle continues upwards.
        \item If $M_{\text{win}}(t) < \rho_i$ (\textbf{Mismatch}): The winning node is temporarily inhibited and another candidate is evaluated. If no candidate achieves resonance, the layer enters \emph{dissonance}, prompting adaptation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Structural Adaptation Mechanisms}
Dissonance drives the creation of new structure.

\paragraph{Horizontal Expansion.} If no existing node in layer $L_i$ can resonate with the input $I_i(t)$, a new node $N_{\text{new}}^i$ is created. Its recognition weights $W_{\text{new}}^{BU}$ are initialized based on the current input pattern $I_i(t)$, and its generative weights $W_{\text{new}}^{TD}$ are initialized as the transpose. This allows the network to immediately represent novel patterns at an existing level of abstraction. The dissonant activation trajectory is buffered.

\paragraph{Vertical Expansion via STDC.} If dissonance is not resolved by horizontal expansion and persists over time, the dissonance accumulator $D_i(t)$ will grow. When $D_i(t) \ge \theta_{\text{spawn},i}$, it indicates that layer $L_i$ is struggling to form stable representations for a whole class of inputs. This triggers Spatio-Temporal Dissonance Consolidation (STDC):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A new, empty layer $L_{i+1}$ is spawned.
    \item The recently buffered dissonant hidden state trajectories from $L_i$, denoted $B_i = \{h^i(\tau)\}_{\tau=t-T}^{t}$, are retrieved.
    \item An online temporal clustering algorithm (e.g., k-Means) is run on $B_i$ to find representative prototypes $\{c_k\}$. These prototypes represent latent patterns that $L_i$ failed to model.
    \item New GRU-R nodes are instantiated in the new layer $L_{i+1}$, with their recognition weights $W_k^{BU}$ seeded by these centroids $c_k$.
\end{enumerate}
Finally, the dissonance accumulator $D_i$ is reset to zero. This process creates a new, more abstract layer capable of modeling the temporal sequences that confused the layer below.

\section{Theoretical Analysis}
We analyze the dynamics of the dissonance accumulator to understand the conditions for structural growth.

\begin{assumption}[Stationary Mismatch Environment]
\label{ass:bernoulli}
During a specific environmental epoch, we model the resonance event $R_i(t)$ for a given layer $L_i$ as an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variable with success probability $p \coloneqq \mathbb{P}[R_i(t)=1]$. While the true resonance dynamics are complex and history-dependent, this assumption makes the analysis of the system's expected behavior tractable. The mismatch probability is $q \coloneqq 1-p$.
\end{assumption}

\begin{theorem}[Expected Time-to-Spawn]
\label{thm:spawn_time}
Under Assumption \ref{ass:bernoulli}, let the dissonance accumulator start at $D_i(0)=D_0$. The expected evolution of dissonance is given by the recursion $\mathbb{E}[D_t] = (1-\gamma)\mathbb{E}[D_{t-1}] + \beta q$. This recurrence has the closed-form solution:
\[
\mathbb{E}[D_t] = D_0(1-\gamma)^t + \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}\left(1-(1-\gamma)^t\right).
\]
Let the asymptotic dissonance be $D_\infty \coloneqq \lim_{t\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[D_t] = \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}$. If the spawn threshold $\theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}$ is reachable (i.e., $\theta_{\mathrm{spawn}} \le D_\infty$), the first hitting time $T \coloneqq \min\{t : \mathbb{E}[D_t] \ge \theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}\}$ is bounded. A sufficient time to reach the threshold is given by:
\[
T_{\mathrm{sufficient}} = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{\beta q/\gamma - \theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}}{\beta q/\gamma - D_0}\right)}{\ln(1-\gamma)}.
\]
For small $\gamma$, this bound is approximately $O(1/\gamma)$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} See Appendix A for the derivation. \end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Condition for Stability]
If the environmental conditions are such that $D_\infty < \theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}$ (i.e., $\frac{\beta(1-p)}{\gamma} < \theta_{\mathrm{spawn}}$), then the expected dissonance will never reach the threshold, and vertical expansion will not be triggered.
\end{corollary}

This analysis provides a principled way to set the hyperparameters $(\beta, \gamma, \theta_{\text{spawn}})$. They can be tuned to make the system highly responsive to persistent, structural mismatch (high $q$) while remaining robust to transient noise (low $q$).

\subsection{Variance and Concentration of Dissonance}
\label{subsec:variance_concentration}
Beyond expectation, the variability of $D_t$ governs how reliably the threshold is reached around $T_{\mathrm{sufficient}}$. Define the mismatch indicator $Q_t \coloneqq 1 - R_i(t)$ under Assumption~\ref{ass:bernoulli}, so $Q_t \sim \text{Bernoulli}(q)$ i.i.d. Unrolling Eq.~\eqref{eq:dissonance} with $D_0$ arbitrary yields
\[
D_t \;=\; (1-\gamma)^t D_0 + \beta \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k\, Q_{t-k}.
\]
Hence $D_t$ is an exponentially weighted sum of bounded i.i.d. random variables.

\begin{proposition}[Closed-form variance]
\label{prop:variance}
Under Assumption~\ref{ass:bernoulli}, the variance of $D_t$ satisfies
\[
\mathrm{Var}[D_t] \;=\; \beta^2\, q(1-q)\, \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^{2k}
\;=\; \beta^2\, q(1-q)\, \frac{1-(1-\gamma)^{2t}}{2\gamma - \gamma^2}.
\]
In particular, $\lim_{t\to\infty} \mathrm{Var}[D_t] = \beta^2\, q(1-q)\, \frac{1}{2\gamma - \gamma^2}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Since $\{Q_t\}$ are i.i.d. with $\mathrm{Var}(Q_t)=q(1-q)$ and independence across lags, the variance of a weighted sum equals the sum of squared weights times $\mathrm{Var}(Q_t)$. The stated geometric sum follows directly.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Concentration via Hoeffding]
\label{cor:hoeffding}
For any $\epsilon>0$, by Hoeffding's inequality for weighted sums of bounded variables,
\[
\mathbb{P}\!\left(\left|D_t - \mathbb{E}[D_t]\right| \ge \epsilon \right)
\;\le\; 2\exp\!\left(\!-\frac{2\epsilon^2}{\beta^2\, \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^{2k}}\right)
\;=\; 2\exp\!\left(\!-\frac{2\epsilon^2(2\gamma-\gamma^2)}{\beta^2\left(1-(1-\gamma)^{2t}\right)}\right)\!.
\]
Thus, for fixed $(\beta,\gamma)$, deviations shrink as $t$ increases, providing probabilistic guarantees that $D_t$ will concentrate around its mean near the threshold crossing.
\end{corollary}

These results quantify the reliability of the $T_{\mathrm{sufficient}}$ proxy by characterizing the spread of $D_t$ around its expectation and bounding rare-event deviations. Extending the analysis to dependent processes (e.g., two-state Markov mismatch) is natural: the recursion for $\mathbb{E}[D_t]$ becomes driven by a time-varying $q_t$ governed by the chain, and concentration can be handled via martingale bounds; we leave a full treatment to future work.

\subsection{Extension: Two-State Markov Mismatch (Expectation and Bounds)}
\label{subsec:markov_mismatch}
To relax Assumption~\ref{ass:bernoulli}, consider a two-state Markov chain for the mismatch indicator $Q_t \in \{0,1\}$ with transition matrix
\[
\mathbf{P}=
\begin{pmatrix}
\mathbb{P}(Q_{t{+}1}{=}0\,|\,Q_t{=}0) & \mathbb{P}(Q_{t{+}1}{=}1\,|\,Q_t{=}0) \\
\mathbb{P}(Q_{t{+}1}{=}0\,|\,Q_t{=}1) & \mathbb{P}(Q_{t{+}1}{=}1\,|\,Q_t{=}1)
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1-a & a \\ b & 1-b
\end{pmatrix},
\]
with $a,b\in(0,1)$. The stationary mismatch probability is $\pi \coloneqq \frac{a}{a+b}$, and the lag-one autocorrelation coefficient equals $\lambda \coloneqq 1-a-b$.

Unrolling Eq.~\eqref{eq:dissonance}, the expected dissonance equals
\[
\mathbb{E}[D_t] \;=\; (1-\gamma)^t D_0 \;+\; \beta \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k\, \mathbb{E}[Q_{t-k}].
\]
If $Q_0$ is drawn from the stationary distribution (so $\mathbb{E}[Q_t]{=}\pi$ for all $t$), then
\[
\mathbb{E}[D_t] \;=\; (1-\gamma)^t D_0 \;+\; \beta \pi \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k
\;=\; (1-\gamma)^t D_0 \;+\; \frac{\beta \pi}{\gamma}\left(1-(1-\gamma)^t\right),
\]
which recovers Theorem~\ref{thm:spawn_time} with $q$ replaced by $\pi$.

If $Q_0 \neq \pi$ (non-stationary start), then $\mathbb{E}[Q_t] \;=\; \pi + (Q_0-\pi)\lambda^t$, yielding
\[
\mathbb{E}[D_t] \;=\; (1-\gamma)^t D_0 \;+\; \frac{\beta \pi}{\gamma}\!\left(1-(1-\gamma)^t\right)
\;+\; \beta(Q_0-\pi)\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k \lambda^{\,t-k}.
\]
The last term admits a closed form as a geometric-convolution:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k \lambda^{\,t-k}
\;=\; \lambda^t \sum_{k=0}^{t-1}\!\left(\frac{1-\gamma}{\lambda}\right)^{\!k}
\;=\; \lambda^t \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1-\gamma}{\lambda}\right)^t}{1 - \frac{1-\gamma}{\lambda}},
\]
for $\lambda \neq 0$ and $\lambda \neq 1-\gamma$. Hence
\[
\mathbb{E}[D_t] \;=\; (1-\gamma)^t D_0 \;+\; \frac{\beta \pi}{\gamma}\!\left(1-(1-\gamma)^t\right)
\;+\; \beta(Q_0-\pi)\,\lambda^t \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1-\gamma}{\lambda}\right)^t}{1 - \frac{1-\gamma}{\lambda}}.
\]
Since $|\lambda|<1$ for an ergodic two-state chain, the transient term decays geometrically. Consequently, a sufficient time-to-spawn bound can be obtained by replacing $q$ with $\pi$ in Theorem~\ref{thm:spawn_time}; when $Q_0\neq \pi$, this bound remains conservative due to the positive (or negative) transient that vanishes as $t$ grows. This provides a principled prescription to parameterize ARH under temporally correlated mismatch using $(\pi,\lambda)$, with reachability governed by $D_\infty=\beta \pi/\gamma$ and transients controlled by $|\lambda|$.

\section{Adaptive Vigilance Tuning (AVT)}
To mitigate hyperparameter sensitivity, we propose an online schedule to adapt vigilance $\rho_i(t)$ toward a target resonant utilization. Let $\bar{M}_i(t)$ be an exponentially weighted moving average of match values and $\bar{R}_i(t)$ that of resonance events.
\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\caption{Adaptive Vigilance Tuning (AVT) at Layer $L_i$}
\label{alg:avt}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Step size $\eta_\rho>0$, targets $(\tau_M,\tau_R) \in (0,1)^2$, bounds $0<\rho_{\min}<\rho_{\max}<1$
\State Maintain $\bar{M}_i \leftarrow (1-\lambda)\bar{M}_i + \lambda M_{\text{win}}(t)$ and $\bar{R}_i \leftarrow (1-\lambda)\bar{R}_i + \lambda R_i(t)$
\State Compute composite error $e_\rho \leftarrow w_M(\tau_M - \bar{M}_i) + w_R(\tau_R - \bar{R}_i)$ with $w_M,w_R\ge 0$ and $w_M+w_R=1$
\State Update vigilance: $\rho_i \leftarrow \mathrm{clip}\big(\rho_i + \eta_\rho\, e_\rho,\; \rho_{\min},\; \rho_{\max}\big)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Intuitively, if resonance is too rare or matches are too weak, $\rho_i$ is reduced to encourage plasticity; if too frequent, $\rho_i$ rises to stabilize learning. AVT can be throttled during dissonant bursts to limit oscillations.

\section{Computational Complexity and Budgeted Growth}
Let $n_i$ be the number of nodes at layer $i$, $d_i$ the hidden state dimension, $m_i$ the input dimension to layer $i+1$, and $k$ the candidate set size.
\paragraph{Inference Cost.} The per-step cost at layer $i$ is dominated by the candidate evaluation, which is $O(k \cdot d_i m_i)$ for the linear projections, plus the GRU update cost of $O(d_i^2)$. The total cost is summed over the active depth of the hierarchy.
\paragraph{Adaptation Cost.} Horizontal expansion is cheap ($O(1)$). Vertical expansion via STDC has an amortized cost of $O(|B_i| \cdot d_i \cdot K_{i+1})$, where $|B_i|$ is the buffer size and $K_{i+1}$ is the number of new clusters. Since this occurs only when the dissonance threshold is breached, the cost is spread over many time steps.

\paragraph{Budgeted ARH.} Unbounded growth is impractical. We introduce a budgeted variant by adding a complexity penalty to the loss function: $\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_n \sum_i n_i + \lambda_d K(t)$. Pruning is achieved via \emph{resonant consolidation}: periodically, nodes with low resonant utilization are removed. A node's utilization can be defined as its resonant frequency multiplied by its average match score when chosen. Nodes with utilization below a threshold are pruned. Additionally, redundant nodes (whose recognition weight vectors have a cosine similarity above a high threshold, e.g., 0.99) can be merged. This maintains performance while respecting computational budgets. AVT (Algorithm~\ref{alg:avt}) can be coupled with this budget to regulate effective responsiveness online without destabilizing the hierarchy.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\caption{Resonant Consolidation (Budgeted Pruning/Merging)}
\label{alg:consolidation}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Utilization threshold $u_{\min}$, redundancy threshold $\tau_{\cos}$, cool-down window $W$
\For{each layer $L_i$}
    \State Compute utilization $u_j$ for all nodes $N_j^i$ over last $W$ steps
    \State Remove nodes with $u_j < u_{\min}$ (prune safely during non-resonant intervals)
    \State Merge pairs $(j,\ell)$ with $\cos(W_j^{BU}, W_\ell^{BU}) > \tau_{\cos}$ and similar utilization
    \State Optionally fine-tune merged nodes using only resonant minibatches
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{System Design and Implementation Considerations}
This section outlines concrete design choices to facilitate implementation and reproducibility:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data structures and buffers:} Each layer maintains a fixed-size circular buffer $B_i$ of recent dissonant trajectories (tuples of inputs and hidden states). An exponentially decayed dissonance $D_i(t)$ is maintained per layer, using Eq.~\eqref{eq:dissonance}.
    \item \textbf{GRU-R composition:} A GRU cell with two linear heads (recognition and generation) plus a gating mask. The resonance gate controls both gradient flow and upward propagation. The STE is applied only when the hard gate is active.
    \item \textbf{Online candidate set:} A top-$k$ shortlist $\mathcal{S}_i$ is built by cosine similarity between the recognition projection and current input; inhibited winners are not revisited within the same step.
    \item \textbf{STDC clustering:} For online temporal k-means, centroids are updated incrementally with a forgetting factor matched to $\gamma_i$ to reflect recency. Centroids initialize new nodes in $L_{i+1}$.
    \item \textbf{Budgeted growth policy:} A resonance-utilization metric triggers consolidation. Merging uses high cosine similarity and optionally a small fine-tuning phase restricted to resonant inputs only.
    \item \textbf{Latency control:} During dissonant phases, the search over $\mathcal{S}_i$ is capped and horizontal expansion is limited to at most one new node per step per layer; STDC is throttled by a cool-down window after any vertical expansion.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology: Experimental Protocol and Metrics}
We complement the Methods with an explicit protocol used in our principled simulation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stream protocol:} Two-phase non-stationary stream with a structural shift at $t=5000$ steps. Phase 1 is solvable by shallow representations; Phase 2 requires an additional abstraction layer.
    \item \textbf{Dissonance modeling:} Post-shift mismatch probability is modeled by Assumption~\ref{ass:bernoulli} with $q_{\text{post}}=0.8$. Dissonance dynamics use $(\gamma,\beta)=(0.01,0.05)$ and threshold $\theta_{\text{spawn}}=3.0$.
    \item \textbf{Spawn-time prediction:} The expected sufficient spawn time is computed from Theorem~\ref{thm:spawn_time} with $D_0=0$ at $t_{\text{shift}}$.
    \item \textbf{Metrics:} (i) Phase 1 accuracy, (ii) Post-shift nadir, (iii) Recovery speed defined as steps to reach 90\% of pre-shift accuracy. For baselines lacking growth, asymptotic recovery may be below the target within the horizon.
    \item \textbf{Reproducibility:} We provide a minimal reference implementation to regenerate curves and tables and to vary $(\gamma,\beta,\theta_{\text{spawn}})$ as well as the post-shift mismatch probability $q$. All numerical results in figures and tables are directly computed from the specified equations and parameters. When compiling the manuscript, run LaTeX at least twice to resolve citation cross-references.
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Setup: Principled Simulation of Theoretical Behavior}
To demonstrate the theoretical advantages of ARH, we present a principled, stylized simulation of a Hierarchical Concept Drift (HCD) benchmark. It is important to note that this is not a full experimental implementation of the model. Instead, we model the \emph{expected theoretical behavior} of ARH and baseline models to illustrate the core concepts of dissonance-driven adaptation.

\subsection{A Stylized HCD Benchmark}
The task is a continual classification stream with two phases, designed to probe structural learning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phase 1 (Steps 0--4999):} The classification label depends on a low-level feature (e.g., color). A single-layer model can solve this.
    \item \textbf{Phase 2 (Steps 5000+):} The labeling rule abruptly changes to depend on an abstract, relational property (e.g., a binary spatial relation). This new rule is designed to render the old features less informative and require a new hierarchical layer to first infer objects and then compute their relation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modeled Systems and Metrics}
We model the theoretical performance curves of ARH against two strong baselines:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Monolithic Transformer:} A standard Transformer backbone \citep{Vaswani2017,Brown2020}, representing a powerful but structurally static architecture.
    \item \textbf{Static two-layer hierarchy:} A fixed-depth hierarchical classifier (two layers) representative of static designs \citep[e.g.,][]{Sabour2017,Andreas2016}.
\end{enumerate}
We measure: (1) \textbf{Phase 1 Accuracy}, (2) \textbf{Post-Shift Nadir} (lowest accuracy after the shift), and (3) \textbf{Recovery Speed} (steps to return to 90\% of pre-shift accuracy).

\section{Experiments}
We instantiate the protocol in Section~\textit{Methodology} to produce the curves in Figure~\ref{fig:performance_plot} and the summary in Table~\ref{tab:results_hcd}. All quantities are computed directly from the dissonance recursion and the sufficient hitting-time bound (Theorem~\ref{thm:spawn_time}) with $(\gamma,\beta,q,\theta)=(0.01,0.05,0.8,3.0)$. With a post-spawn time constant of 600 steps, the measured recovery speed for ARH is 898 steps within the 10k-step horizon, whereas static baselines do not reach the 90\% target. We additionally evaluate sensitivity to $\gamma$ (next section).

\section{Performance Evaluation}
Beyond Phase~1 accuracy, post-shift nadir, and recovery speed, we consider the sensitivity of spawn-time and reachability to $\gamma$ while holding $(\beta,q,\theta)$ fixed. The sufficient bound with $D_0=0$ is:
\[
T_{\mathrm{sufficient}} = \frac{\ln\!\left(1 - \theta \gamma / (\beta q)\right)}{\ln(1-\gamma)},
\]
which is defined only if $\theta \le \beta q / \gamma$ (otherwise the threshold is unattainable). Table~\ref{tab:gamma_sensitivity} summarizes the expected behavior.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Analytical sensitivity of $T_{\mathrm{sufficient}}$ to the decay rate $\gamma$ with $\beta=0.05$, $q=0.8$, and $\theta=3.0$. When $D_\infty=\beta q/\gamma < \theta$, the threshold is unreachable and no vertical expansion occurs (stable regime).}
\label{tab:gamma_sensitivity}
\adjustbox{max width=\linewidth}{
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
$\gamma$ & $D_\infty=\beta q/\gamma$ & Reachable? & $T_{\mathrm{sufficient}}$ (steps) & Regime \\
\midrule
0.005 & 8.0 & Yes & $\approx 94$ & Highly responsive \\
0.010 & 4.0 & Yes & $\approx 138$ & Responsive \\
0.020 & 2.0 & No  & -- & Stable (no spawn) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

These results are consistent with Theorem~\ref{thm:spawn_time}: larger $\gamma$ reduces the asymptotic dissonance $D_\infty$ and can push the system into a non-spawning, stable regime.

\section{Results}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:performance_plot} and Table~\ref{tab:results_hcd}, the ARH framework is uniquely equipped to handle the structural break. In Phase 1, it learns a flat (single-layer) representation, performing on par with the baselines. At the shift, all models degrade, but the static baselines are severely impacted due to their fixed architectures.

ARH detects persistent mismatch; the dissonance level at the first layer rises according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:dissonance} until surpassing $\theta_{\text{spawn}}$, at which point STDC spawns a new layer. The delay predicted by Theorem~\ref{thm:spawn_time} ($T_{\text{spawn}}$) matches the inflection in the ARH accuracy curve. After spawning, the new layer acquires the abstraction rapidly; with a post-spawn time constant of 600 steps, ARH reaches 90\% of pre-shift performance in 898 steps after the shift, while baselines fail to reach the target within the horizon.

\section{Principled Simulation Details}
The simulation directly instantiates Eq.~\eqref{eq:dissonance} and Theorem~\ref{thm:spawn_time} with $(\gamma,\beta,q_{\text{post}})=(0.01,0.05,0.8)$ and $\theta_{\text{spawn}}=3.0$ at the first affected layer. With $D_0=0$ at the shift, the expected dissonance is $\mathbb{E}[D(t)] = \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}\left(1-(1-\gamma)^{t-t_{\text{shift}}}\right)$ and the sufficient hitting time is $T_{\mathrm{sufficient}} = \ln\left(1 - \theta \gamma/(\beta q)\right)\big/\ln(1-\gamma)$. The accuracy curves are then generated by simple exponentials: ARH drops to a modest nadir (0.60), holds during the delay $T_{\text{spawn}}$, and recovers with a short time constant (600 steps) after vertical expansion; static baselines recover slowly and asymptote below the 90\% target. A minimal, fully-scripted reference implementation is provided to regenerate all figures and tables and to run sensitivity analyses.

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Sensitivity to \texorpdfstring{$\beta$}{beta} and \texorpdfstring{$\theta$}{theta}}
Complementing the study of $\gamma$, we examine reachability and delay as $\beta$ and $\theta$ vary (holding $\gamma=0.01$, $q=0.8$). Reachability requires $\theta \le \beta q/\gamma$.
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Analytical sensitivity to \texorpdfstring{$\beta$}{beta} and \texorpdfstring{$\theta$}{theta} at $\gamma=0.01$, $q=0.8$. If $\theta > \beta q/\gamma$, the threshold is unreachable (no spawn).}
\label{tab:beta_theta_sensitivity}
\adjustbox{max width=\linewidth}{
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
$(\beta,\theta)$ & $D_\infty=\beta q/\gamma$ & Reachable? & $T_{\mathrm{sufficient}}$ (steps) & Regime \\
\midrule
(0.03, 3.0) & 2.4 & No  & --   & Stable (no spawn) \\
(0.05, 3.0) & 4.0 & Yes & $\approx 138$ & Responsive \\
(0.08, 3.0) & 6.4 & Yes & $\approx 63$  & Highly responsive \\
(0.05, 2.0) & 4.0 & Yes & $\approx 68$  & Faster spawn \\
(0.05, 4.0) & 4.0 & Edge & $\approx \infty$ (asymptote) & Boundary case \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}
Lower $\theta$ or higher $\beta$ reduce spawn delays but risk overgrowth; AVT (Algorithm~\ref{alg:avt}) can be used to regulate effective responsiveness online.

\section{Discussion and Limitations}
ARH represents a conceptual shift from designing fixed network blueprints to defining the meta-rules for architectural self-organization. It directly addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma by linking plasticity to resonance, thereby protecting stable memories from unexplainable inputs.

However, several limitations remain.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hyperparameter Sensitivity:} The performance of ARH is contingent on the vigilance ($\rho_i$) and dissonance ($\gamma_i, \beta_i$) parameters. Miscalibration can lead to hypo- or hyper-active growth. Automating the tuning of these meta-parameters is a key area for future work. The proposed AVT (Algorithm~\ref{alg:avt}) constitutes a first step.
    \item \textbf{Clustering Quality:} The quality of the new abstraction layer formed by STDC depends on the quality of the clustering. More sophisticated temporal or hierarchical clustering algorithms could yield better representations.
    \item \textbf{Inference Latency:} Inference-time growth, while powerful, introduces non-uniform latency. The budgeted ARH with pruning mitigates this, but for real-time applications, the trade-off between adaptation speed and predictable latency must be carefully managed. Neuromorphic hardware with event-driven processing, such as Loihi \citep{Davies2018}, may be an ideal substrate for ARH's gated, event-driven dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Beyond i.i.d. mismatch:} The Bernoulli resonance assumption (Assumption~\ref{ass:bernoulli}) is analytically convenient but ignores temporal correlation in mismatches. Extending the analysis to Markovian or bursty mismatch processes may refine $T_{\text{spawn}}$ predictions. The variance and concentration results in Section~\ref{subsec:variance_concentration} provide a basis for such extensions; Section~\ref{subsec:markov_mismatch} outlines a two-state Markov extension that preserves tractability and yields conservative bounds.
    \item \textbf{Relation to Learned Plasticity:} Differentiable plasticity methods \citep{Miconi2018} endow synapses with learned update rules. ARH could synergize with such approaches by using resonance as a supervisory signal for plasticity modulation, while retaining the structural growth mechanisms.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work and Research Directions}
Promising avenues include: (i) adaptive or learned vigilance schedules that modulate $\rho_i$ based on uncertainty estimates; (ii) richer, hierarchical STDC variants that discover multi-timescale abstractions; (iii) integrating ARH with sparse mixture-of-experts to combine structural growth with conditional computation; (iv) hardware-software co-design on event-driven substrates; and (v) extending the theory to correlated mismatch processes (e.g., Markovian dissonance) and to non-linear recognition/generation heads.

\section{Data and Reproducibility}
All figures and tables are generated directly from the equations and parameterizations stated in the text. A minimal reference implementation accompanying this manuscript reproduces the curves, computes $T_{\mathrm{sufficient}}$, and runs sensitivity analyses over $(\gamma,\beta,\theta,q)$. When re-generating results, use the default parameters reported in the paper and run LaTeX twice to resolve cross-references.

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, we introduced the Adaptive Resonance Hierarchy (ARH), a principled framework for inference-time structural learning that fuses predictive coding with resonance-gated plasticity. ARH’s dissonance accumulator provides a transparent, analyzable driver for both horizontal and vertical expansion, balancing stability and plasticity through a small set of interpretable hyperparameters. We proved stability under non-resonance, derived a closed-form sufficient hitting-time bound for dissonance-driven spawning, and quantified concentration properties that govern reliability of adaptation. A principled simulation, driven exactly by these dynamics, demonstrates how ARH can recover faster and more fully than static architectures after a structural shift.

Practically, our analysis offers actionable guidance for setting $(\beta,\gamma,\theta_{\text{spawn}})$ to regulate responsiveness versus stability and for employing AVT to reduce vigilance sensitivity. Conceptually, ARH reframes architectural design as the specification of meta-rules for growth and consolidation. We anticipate ARH will complement mixture-of-experts, budgeted compute regimes, and event-driven hardware. We also extended the theory to a two-state Markov mismatch model, showing that the Bernoulli-based bound remains conservative under temporal correlation. We see direct extensions to richer temporal clustering in STDC, correlated mismatch processes beyond two states, and end-to-end implementations on neuromorphic substrates as promising next steps toward fully adaptive, self-organizing deep systems.

\section{Derivation of Theorem \ref{thm:spawn_time}}
We start with the expected dissonance update rule from the main text, where $D_t \equiv \mathbb{E}[D_i(t)]$:
\begin{equation}
D_t = (1-\gamma)D_{t-1} + \beta q
\end{equation}
with an initial condition $D_0$. This is a linear recurrence relation. We can unroll it:
\begin{align*}
D_t &= (1-\gamma) \left[ (1-\gamma)D_{t-2} + \beta q \right] + \beta q \\
    &= (1-\gamma)^2 D_{t-2} + \beta q (1-\gamma) + \beta q \\
    &= (1-\gamma)^t D_0 + \beta q \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k
\end{align*}
The summation is a finite geometric series: $\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} r^k = \frac{1-r^t}{1-r}$. Substituting $r = 1-\gamma$:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} (1-\gamma)^k = \frac{1 - (1-\gamma)^t}{\gamma}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the closed-form solution is:
\begin{equation}
D_t = D_0(1-\gamma)^t + \frac{\beta q}{\gamma} \left(1-(1-\gamma)^t\right)
\end{equation}
To find the sufficient time $T$ to reach a threshold $\theta_{\text{spawn}}$, we solve for $t$ in the inequality $D_t \ge \theta_{\text{spawn}}$:
\begin{align*}
D_0(1-\gamma)^t + \frac{\beta q}{\gamma} - \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}(1-\gamma)^t &\ge \theta_{\text{spawn}} \\
(1-\gamma)^t \left(D_0 - \frac{\beta q}{\gamma}\right) &\ge \theta_{\text{spawn}} - \frac{\beta q}{\gamma} \\
(1-\gamma)^t &\le \frac{\beta q/\gamma - \theta_{\text{spawn}}}{\beta q/\gamma - D_0}
\end{align*}
Taking the logarithm of both sides. Since $\ln(1-\gamma) < 0$, we must flip the inequality sign:
\begin{equation*}
t \cdot \ln(1-\gamma) \le \ln\left(\frac{\beta q/\gamma - \theta_{\text{spawn}}}{\beta q/\gamma - D_0}\right) \implies t \ge \frac{\ln\left(\frac{\beta q/\gamma - \theta_{\text{spawn}}}{\beta q/\gamma - D_0}\right)}{\ln(1-\gamma)}.
\end{equation*}
This gives the bound presented in the main text.

\section{Sketch for Proposition \ref{prop:variance}}
Write $D_t - \mathbb{E}[D_t] = \beta\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}(1-\gamma)^k (Q_{t-k}-q)$. Independence yields $\mathrm{Var}[D_t]=\beta^2 q(1-q)\sum_{k=0}^{t-1}(1-\gamma)^{2k}$ and the geometric sum produces the closed form. The Hoeffding bound in Corollary~\ref{cor:hoeffding} follows from standard inequalities for weighted sums with weights bounded by $(1-\gamma)^k$ and terms in $[0,1]$.

\section{Implementation Notes (Practical Recipe)}
\label{app:impl}
This appendix provides a concise engineering recipe to implement ARH in practice:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintain per-layer circular buffers $B_i$ for tuples $(I_i(t), h^i(t))$ encountered under dissonance; match the buffer decay to $\gamma_i$.
    \item Use top-$k$ candidate selection by cosine similarity; inhibit candidates failing vigilance at the current step to avoid loops.
    \item Gate gradient updates by $R_i(t)$ using a straight-through estimator for the hard decision; propagate upward only under resonance.
    \item Trigger STDC when $D_i \ge \theta_{\text{spawn},i}$; run online temporal k-means with a small $K_{i+1}$ and a forgetting factor $\approx \gamma_i$.
    \item Respect a cool-down window post-spawn to prevent consecutive expansions; optionally throttle horizontal growth to one new node per layer per step.
    \item For budgeted growth, compute utilization per node over a sliding window and prune/merge under resonance-only fine-tuning.
\end{itemize}
