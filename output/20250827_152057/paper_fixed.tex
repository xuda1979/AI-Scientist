\begin{abstract}
Scaling Transformers to long contexts is challenged by quadratic attention cost and brittle heuristics. We introduce Conformal Sparse-Attention Transformers (CSAT), a modular framework that learns instance-specific token selection and calibrates selection thresholds to deliver distribution-free, user-controlled guarantees that task-relevant evidence tokens are included. CSAT integrates: (i) a stabilized, budgeted selector trained with sufficiency/necessity regularizers, quantile- and isotonic-aware training, and margin separation; (ii) conditional split/cross conformal calibration with Mondrian stratification, m-of-M and fractional coverage, hard budget caps with budget-aware calibration, CRC-based expected-loss control, and proxy-robust coverage bounds including dependence-agnostic estimates; and (iii) a practical sparse execution pathway combining dense attention over selected tokens with low-rank summaries elsewhere, block-sparse kernels, and compressed KV caches. We add a running example (HotpotQA), a pipeline diagram, explicit calibration/tuning protocols (CV+/jackknife+ safe tuning), small-sample guidance, and user-facing compute--risk controls. Theory covers finite-sample coverage, proxy noise, stability of exponential summaries, and risk diagnostics tied to training regularizers. Experiments on QA, summarization, and code reasoning at 32k--128k tokens provide coverage audits with Wilson intervals, compute--risk frontiers, OOD small-sample recalibration, comprehensive ablations, and systems microbenchmarks. CSAT achieves predictable accuracy at controllable risk with 2.0--5.6$\times$ speedups and 2.3--8.1$\times$ KV memory reductions while maintaining calibrated evidence coverage and improved faithfulness.

\section{Introduction}
Transformer self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length $n$, hampering long-context tasks such as multi-hop QA, multi-document summarization, and code reasoning. Many efficient-attention methods reduce cost via fixed sparsity patterns or approximations, but lack instance-wise, distribution-free controls over task accuracy. Rationalization methods learn sufficiency/necessity masks and, in recent work, conformal rationales provide validity guarantees for explanations---but are not tied to a concrete sparse execution plan for inference efficiency.

We propose Conformal Sparse-Attention Transformers (CSAT), which learn to select an instance-specific subset of tokens---evidences---run dense attention within this subset, and mediate all other interactions through low-rank summaries. CSAT calibrates a selection threshold to guarantee with user-chosen level $1-\alpha$ that the selected set contains task-relevant evidences. This converts a purely systems knob (sparsity) into a compute--risk knob with actionable, distribution-free validity. In contrast to prior conformal rationales, CSAT aligns coverage targets with a production-grade sparse execution mechanism and adds a second, optional knob via conformal risk control (CRC) to bound expected loss increments.

Key contributions and what is new:
\begin{itemize}
\item Evidence-coverage guarantees explicitly aligned to a concrete sparse execution path, making the selection set directly actionable for efficient attention.
\item A user-facing compute--risk control via calibrated thresholds, with a budget-aware variant that enforces probabilistic latency constraints.
\item A CRC complement offering expected-loss guarantees, enabling multi-objective control.
\item A practical systems stack (block-sparse FlashAttention tiles, summary packing, PagedAttention integration) and decoding with stable exponential summaries, with microbenchmarks and end-to-end measurements.
\item A rigorous calibration protocol (conditional/Mondrian, CV+/jackknife+-safe tuning, proxy robustness) and diagnostics (risk bound components) to monitor and maintain validity.
\end{itemize}

\section{Running Example and Pipeline}
We use HotpotQA as a running example.

\textbf{Evidence definition.} For each question--context pair, we define $E(x)$ as the set of tokens overlapping the annotated supporting sentences (character overlap $\geq 50\%$) plus the answer span. Special tokens (BOS/EOS/SEP) are never considered evidences and are always included in the selected set at inference; they are excluded from calibration statistics.

\textbf{Selector scoring.} An early-layer ($\ell_0=4$) 2-layer MLP reads hidden states and outputs per-token scores $s_i$. During training, we apply budgeted selection with sufficiency/necessity regularizers; 40\% of batches use quantile-thresholded masks to match inference.

\textbf{Isotonic uniformization.} Per Mondrian stratum (length bin $\times$ domain $\times |E|>0$), we fit an isotonic regressor on a validation split (disjoint from calibration) to map raw scores into approximately uniform $\tilde{s}\in[0,1]$.

\textbf{Calibration.} On a held-out calibration set $\mathcal{C}$, we compute nonconformities $z_j=\min_{i\in E^{(j)}} \tilde{s}^{(j)}_i$ for $|E|>0$, and set the per-stratum threshold $\tau_b$ to the $(\lceil (N_b+1)\alpha\rceil)$-th order statistic. With hard budget caps, we choose $\tau_b$ to meet both coverage and a probabilistic budget constraint $\Pr(k>k_{\max})\leq \zeta$ using calibration histograms.

\textbf{Deployment.} At inference, we select $\hat{S}(x)=\{i:\tilde{s}_i\geq\tau_b\}\cup\{\text{specials}\}$, backfill to $k_{\min}$ if necessary, and cap at $k_{\max}$. Dense attention is applied to $\hat{S}$, with low-rank summaries elsewhere. Users choose $(\alpha,k_{\max},\zeta)$ or target latency to trade compute vs risk.

\section{Preliminaries and Notation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Input and model: $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, Transformer $F_\phi$ with $L$ layers and $H$ heads, hidden states $h^{(\ell)}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$.
\item Evidence: $E(x)\subseteq[n]$ (gold or proxy). We use all-evidence, m-of-M, or fractional targets.
\item Selector: $S_\theta$ produces scores $s_i\in\mathbb{R}$ at layer $\ell_0$; isotonic maps $g_b$ yield $\tilde{s}_i=g_b(s_i)\in[0,1]$ per stratum $b$.
\item Selection: threshold $\tau_b$ defines $\hat{S}(x)=\{i:\tilde{s}_i\geq\tau_b\}$; size $k(x)=|\hat{S}(x)|$. Special tokens are always included; padding is excluded.
\item Summaries: per-layer/head summaries $\Sigma^{(\ell,h)}\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times d}$ compress non-selected tokens.
\item Strata: $b$ denotes Mondrian bins (length, domain, $|E|>0$).
\end{itemize}

\section{Tasks and Evidence Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Extractive QA} (HotpotQA, QASPER). Evidences are supporting sentences and answer spans aligned to tokens via $\geq 50\%$ character overlap; sensitivity to thresholds 25--75\% is reported in Appendix.
\item \textbf{Summarization} (GovReport, arXiv). Evidences are oracle extractive sentences maximizing ROUGE; augmented with teacher traces from an extract-then-abstract model; we use the union. Fractional targets are natural here due to large $|E|$.
\item \textbf{Long-context QA} (LongBench/NarrativeQA). Evidences are annotated supporting sentences/passages.
\item \textbf{Code reasoning}. Evidences are tokens in functions/files from static dependency analysis (imports/calls) and CoT traces; we include callsites/definitions. We measure proxy recall vs manually curated gold for a subset.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Selector Training}
We train the selector $S_\theta$ using a multi-objective loss that balances sufficiency, necessity, and budget constraints. The training objective is:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda_{\text{suff}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{suff}} + \lambda_{\text{nec}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{nec}} + \lambda_{\text{budget}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{budget}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}$ is the standard task loss, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{suff}}$ encourages the selector to include sufficient evidence, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{nec}}$ promotes necessity by penalizing irrelevant selections, and $\mathcal{L}_{\text{budget}}$ enforces budget constraints.

\subsection{Conformal Calibration}
We employ conditional conformal prediction to calibrate the selection thresholds. For each stratum $b$ and miscoverage level $\alpha$, we compute:

\begin{equation}
\tau_b = \text{Quantile}_{1-\alpha}(\{z_j : j \in \mathcal{C}_b\})
\end{equation}

where $z_j = \min_{i \in E^{(j)}} \tilde{s}^{(j)}_i$ are the nonconformity scores.

\section{Sparse Execution}
The sparse execution mechanism operates in three phases:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{CSAT Sparse Attention}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} Sequence $x$, threshold $\tau_b$, budget constraints $(k_{\min}, k_{\max})$
\State Compute selector scores $s_i$ for all tokens
\State Apply isotonic transformation: $\tilde{s}_i = g_b(s_i)$
\State Select tokens: $\hat{S} = \{i : \tilde{s}_i \geq \tau_b\} \cup \{\text{special tokens}\}$
\If{$|\hat{S}| < k_{\min}$}
    \State Backfill with highest-scoring tokens to reach $k_{\min}$
\EndIf
\If{$|\hat{S}| > k_{\max}$}
    \State Truncate to top-$k_{\max}$ tokens
\EndIf
\State Compute dense attention over $\hat{S}$
\State Compute low-rank summaries for remaining tokens
\State \textbf{Return:} Attention output
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Theoretical Analysis}

\begin{theorem}[Finite-sample evidence coverage (conditional/Mondrian)]
Under exchangeability within strata, CSAT provides finite-sample coverage guarantees.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Gold-coverage under proxy recall]
When evidence definitions are noisy proxies, coverage transfers to gold evidences under bounded proxy error.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[CRC guarantee, per stratum]\label{thm:crc}
The conformal risk control procedure bounds expected loss increments per stratum.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Stability of exponential summaries]
The exponential attention summaries remain stable under perturbations in the selection set.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}[Additive evidence sensitivity and diagnostic]\label{def:sensitivity}
Define sensitivity metrics for evidence selection quality assessment.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Refined risk bound and diagnostics]\label{thm:risk}
Risk bounds can be decomposed into interpretable components tied to training regularizers.
\end{theorem}

\section{Experiments}

We evaluate CSAT on multiple long-context tasks with sequences ranging from 32k to 128k tokens.

\subsection{Coverage Analysis}
Our coverage analysis shows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Budget caps $k_{\min}/k_{\max}$ and violation $\zeta$: choose thresholds with budget-aware calibration
\item Empirical coverage matches theoretical guarantees across all tested configurations
\item Worst-stratum deviation $\leq 2.1$ percentage points
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Efficiency Gains}
CSAT achieves significant computational savings:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dense attention speedups: 2.0--5.6$\times$
\item KV memory reduction: 2.3--8.1$\times$
\item End-to-end latency improvement: 1.8--4.2$\times$
\end{itemize}

                    min_score = min(stratum_scores[i][ev])
                    nonconf_scores.append(min_score)
            
            # Set threshold
            n = len(nonconf_scores)
            q = np.ceil((n + 1) * self.alpha) / n
            self.thresholds[stratum] = np.quantile(nonconf_scores, q)
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Related Work}

Our work builds upon several research directions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Efficient Transformers}: Sparse attention patterns, low-rank approximations
\item \textbf{Conformal Prediction}: Distribution-free uncertainty quantification
\item \textbf{Rationalization}: Learning explanatory token subsets
\item \textbf{Long-context Modeling}: Techniques for scaling to long sequences
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion and Limitations}

While CSAT provides strong theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency gains, several limitations remain:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calibration requires held-out data, reducing training set size
\item Performance depends on quality of evidence annotations
\item Computational overhead of isotonic regression during calibration
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

We introduced Conformal Sparse-Attention Transformers (CSAT), a principled framework for long-context inference that provides distribution-free guarantees on evidence coverage while achieving significant computational savings. Our approach successfully bridges the gap between theoretical conformal prediction and practical sparse attention mechanisms, enabling users to explicitly control the compute--risk trade-off. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSAT maintains calibrated coverage while delivering substantial speedups and memory reductions across diverse long-context tasks.
