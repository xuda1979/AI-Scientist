\title{Neuro-Deliberation at Test Time: Learning from Human Brain Thinking Patterns to Improve Large Language Model Reasoning}
\author{Anonymous}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Neuroscience has uncovered core motifs of human deliberation: limited-capacity working memory, conflict monitoring, rhythmic coordination, and prioritized replay.
In parallel, recent prompting and inference-time strategies for large language models (LLMs)---such as chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree search, and reflective self-improvement---demonstrate that allocating more computation at test time can substantially improve reasoning.
We propose a neuro-inspired inference procedure, Conflict-Aware Replay Deliberation (CARD), that combines three principles grounded in cognitive neuroscience: (i) conflict monitoring to detect uncertainty and allocate additional computation, (ii) prioritized replay of promising partial thoughts, and (iii) rhythmic scheduling of exploration and evaluation phases.
We evaluate CARD on a stylized, fully reproducible simulation of reasoning under uncertainty with realistic test-time compute scaling, and show consistent accuracy gains over equal self-consistency at the same average budget.
We provide a formalization, analysis of compute--accuracy trade-offs, and a reliability assessment, and we place the approach in the context of contemporary LLM reasoning methods and foundational cognitive mechanisms.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Human reasoning balances rapid intuition with deliberative control, allocating effort based on conflict and uncertainty \citep{Baddeley2012WorkingMemory,Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring,Fries2015Rhythms,Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay,Gershman2018Hippocampus}.
LLMs benefit from analogous inference-time computation and structure \citep{Wei2022CoT,Kojima2022ZeroShot,Wang2023SelfConsistency,Yao2023ToT,Yao2023ReAct,Shinn2023Reflexion,Madaan2023SelfRefine,Zelikman2022STAR,Lightman2023LetsVerify,Lewis2020RAG}.
These techniques can be viewed as allocating test-time compute and selecting among multiple candidate thoughts, similar in spirit to cognitive control and replay in the brain.

We introduce CARD, a neuro-inspired inference schedule that adaptively allocates additional samples to uncertain problems, selectively replays promising thoughts, and alternates between exploration and evaluation.
We show, in a controlled simulation with closed-form analytics, that CARD consistently outperforms equal self-consistency at fixed average test-time budgets, and improves calibration.
Our contributions are:
- A principled inference-time procedure inspired by conflict monitoring and prioritized replay.
- An analytic simulation framework for compute scaling with exact mixture accuracy and adaptive allocation under a budget.
- Empirical evidence of improved accuracy and reliability, with full reproducibility and clear reporting.

\section{Related Work}
Reasoning with LLMs can be improved by eliciting intermediate steps \citep{Wei2022CoT}, zero-shot chain-of-thought \citep{Kojima2022ZeroShot}, self-consistency majority voting \citep{Wang2023SelfConsistency}, decomposition and search \citep{Yao2023ToT}, reasoning-and-acting \citep{Yao2023ReAct}, reflective feedback \citep{Shinn2023Reflexion,Madaan2023SelfRefine}, bootstrapping with rationales \citep{Zelikman2022STAR}, and stepwise verification \citep{Lightman2023LetsVerify}.
Scaling laws emphasize the role of compute at both training and inference \citep{Kaplan2020ScalingLaws,Hoffmann2022Chinchilla}, while frontier models exhibit emergent reasoning \citep{OpenAI2023GPT4,Bubeck2023Sparks,Brown2020GPT3}.
Our work connects these LLM strategies to cognitive and neural principles: working memory and control \citep{Baddeley2012WorkingMemory,Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring}, rhythmic coordination \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}, and prioritized replay for planning \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay,Gershman2018Hippocampus}.

\section{Methodology}
We study inference-time computation on a mixture of problem difficulties.
Each instance admits $k$ independent samples of a thought process leading to an answer; taking a majority vote yields accuracy that depends on the base per-sample correctness probability $p$ and the number of samples $k$.
For even $k$, ties are broken uniformly at random.

\subsection{Mixture model and compute scaling}
Let levels $\ell=1,\dots,L$ have mixture weights $w_\ell$ and base per-sample correctness $p_\ell$.
The correctness of majority voting among $k$ i.i.d.\ samples for level $\ell$ is
\[
\mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k) = \sum_{i=\lfloor k/2\rfloor + 1}^{k} \binom{k}{i} p_\ell^i (1-p_\ell)^{k-i} + \frac{\mathbb{1}[k \text{ even}]}{2}\binom{k}{k/2} p_\ell^{k/2}(1-p_\ell)^{k/2}.
\]
Mixture accuracy is $A(k)=\sum_{\ell} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k)$, which increases with $k$ for $p_\ell>1/2$.
Note: with random tie-breaking, $\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m)=\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m{-}1)$, so equal-allocation curves exhibit plateaus at even $k$.

\subsection{Conflict-Aware Replay Deliberation (CARD)}
CARD adaptively assigns additional samples (test-time compute) conditioned on predicted difficulty and conflict.
We formalize the allocation as the following constrained optimization:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allocation}
\begin{aligned}
&\underset{\{K_\ell\in\mathbb{N}\}_{\ell=1}^L}{\text{maximize}} && \sum_{\ell=1}^{L} w_\ell \,\mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell)\\
&\text{subject to} && \sum_{\ell=1}^{L} w_\ell K_\ell = B.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We solve this via greedy water-filling: start with $K_\ell \!=\! 1$ for all levels and repeatedly increment $K_\ell$ for the level with the largest marginal improvement $\mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell{+}1) {-} \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell)$ until reaching the budget.
Final fine-tuning proportionally mixes $K_\ell$ and $K_\ell{+}1$ at one level to exactly match $B$.

Prioritized replay is implemented by focusing additional samples on levels with the highest marginal utility (a proxy for conflict/uncertainty), akin to hippocampal replay that prioritizes behaviorally relevant content \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay}.
Exploration and evaluation alternate rhythmically: batches of candidate thoughts are sampled, then evaluated by majority voting; this alternation is analogous to rhythmic coordination hypotheses in cognitive neuroscience \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Conflict-Aware Replay Deliberation (CARD)}
\label{alg:card}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Input: mixture levels $\{(w_\ell,p_\ell)\}_{\ell=1}^L$, average budget $B \ge 1$
\STATE Initialize $K_\ell \leftarrow 1$ for all $\ell$, compute $\bar{K} \leftarrow \sum_\ell w_\ell K_\ell$
\WHILE{$\bar{K} + \min_\ell w_\ell \le B$}
  \STATE For each $\ell$, compute marginal gain $g_\ell \leftarrow \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell{+}1) - \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell)$
  \STATE Let $\ell^\star \leftarrow \arg\max_\ell g_\ell$ (conflict-aware selection)
  \STATE $K_{\ell^\star} \leftarrow K_{\ell^\star} + 1$
  \STATE $\bar{K} \leftarrow \sum_\ell w_\ell K_\ell$
\ENDWHILE
\IF{$\bar{K} < B$}
  \STATE Choose $\ell^\star \leftarrow \arg\max_\ell g_\ell$
  \STATE Let $\alpha \leftarrow \frac{B - \bar{K}}{w_{\ell^\star}} \in [0,1]$ (fraction of level $\ell^\star$ instances receiving one more sample)
  \STATE Return $\sum_{\ell\neq \ell^\star} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell) + w_{\ell^\star}[(1{-}\alpha)\mathrm{Acc}(p_{\ell^\star},K_{\ell^\star}) + \alpha \mathrm{Acc}(p_{\ell^\star},K_{\ell^\star}{+}1)]$
\ELSE
  \STATE Return $\sum_{\ell} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell)$
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{System architecture}
We depict CARDâ€™s inference-time pipeline: exploration (sample thoughts), conflict estimation (marginal-utility proxy), prioritized replay (allocate more samples to conflicted levels), and evaluation (majority vote), alternating rhythmically.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{CARD pipeline: alternating exploration and evaluation, with conflict-aware prioritized replay under a global budget.}
\label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Computational complexity and properties}
Let $L$ be the number of difficulty levels and $B$ the average budget.
- Complexity: The greedy water-filling loop adds at most $O(B/\min_\ell w_\ell)$ unit steps; each step scans $L$ levels to compute $g_\ell$, so time $O(L \cdot B/\min_\ell w_\ell)$; memory $O(L)$. With a priority queue keyed by $g_\ell$, the amortized time can be reduced to $O((B/\min_\ell w_\ell)\log L)$.
- Monotonicity: For $p>1/2$, $\mathrm{Acc}(p,k)$ is non-decreasing in $k$; the greedy algorithm therefore never reduces accuracy when increasing the budget.
- Even-odd plateaus: With random tie-breaking, $\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m)=\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m{-}1)$, implying equal-allocation plateaus at even $k$, whereas CARD achieves gains by redistributing compute (e.g., mixing $k{=}3$ and $k{=}1$ across instances to meet $B{=}2$).

\paragraph{Remark (greedy optimality under discrete concave gains).}
When per-level marginal gains $\Delta_k = \mathrm{Acc}(p,k{+}1)-\mathrm{Acc}(p,k)$ are non-increasing in $k$ (discrete concavity), the water-filling allocation is optimal for \eqref{eq:allocation}. Majority-vote accuracy with $p>1/2$ exhibits diminishing returns, providing intuition for the near-optimality of the greedy CARD schedule.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Setup}
We instantiate five difficulty levels:
\[
\{(p_\ell,w_\ell)\}_{\ell=1}^{5} = \{(0.75,0.10),\ (0.65,0.20),\ (0.60,0.30),\ (0.55,0.25),\ (0.52,0.15)\}.
\]
Budgets are $B \in \{1,2,4,8,16\}$ samples per instance on average.
Equal self-consistency (EqualSC) uses the same number of samples for all instances; CARD follows Algorithm~\ref{alg:card}.
We report mixture accuracy and approximate standard errors for a large synthetic sample size.
Implementation and reproducibility: our simulator is deterministic (fixed seed), regenerates all figure data used in this paper, and writes both machine-readable data files and a human-readable summary. Confidenceâ€“accuracy pairs are computed from the mixture across difficulty levels and budgets.

\paragraph{Reproduction protocol.}
\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Experiment Reproduction Protocol}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Fix random seed; define mixture levels $(p_\ell,w_\ell)$ and budgets $\{1,2,4,8,16\}$.
\STATE Compute majority-vote accuracies $\mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k)$ in closed form for required $k$.
\STATE Generate EqualSC curve by evaluating $A(k)=\sum_\ell w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k)$ for each budget $k$.
\STATE Generate CARD curve using the greedy allocation with fractional mixing to exactly match budget $B$.
\STATE Write accuracy-vs-budget data and confidenceâ€“accuracy pairs to data files and produce plots.
\STATE Produce a human-readable summary including approximate standard errors for $N=50{,}000$ synthetic examples.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Results within the experimental setup}
Figure~\ref{fig:acc} shows accuracy increasing with test-time compute for both methods, with consistent gains for CARD at the same average budget.
Table~\ref{tab:summary} reports representative points for EqualSC.
A reliability analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:rel}) indicates improved calibration as compute increases, consistent with the intuition that more votes reduce variance and ambiguity \citep{Wang2023SelfConsistency,Lightman2023LetsVerify}.

\subsection{Neuroscience-grounded interpretation}
- Conflict monitoring: CARD detects ambiguity via marginal utility of extra samples, analogous to anterior cingulate monitoring of conflict and the recruitment of control \citep{Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring}.
- Prioritized replay: allocating additional thought samples where they most improve accuracy mirrors prioritized memory access \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay}.
- Rhythmic control: alternating exploration and evaluation resembles rhythmic coordination facilitating effective communication between neural populations \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}.

\subsection{Comparative analysis to prior inference-time strategies}
We position CARD among inference-time strategies:
- Equal self-consistency: fixed $k$ samples per instance; simple, robust, but allocates compute uniformly regardless of uncertainty.
- Tree/search-based methods (e.g., ToT): allocate compute adaptively via branching; powerful but higher orchestration overhead.
- Reflective methods (Reflexion/Self-Refine): iterative improvement with feedback; complement CARDâ€™s conflict-based allocation.
- Verification (stepwise checking): orthogonal; can be integrated with CARD to direct compute toward uncertain or unverifiable steps.
CARD is complementary, providing a lightweight, analytically grounded scheduler that can sit atop these techniques.

\section{Results}
We summarize the main quantitative outcomes across budgets and methods and report approximate standard errors (computed as $\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$ with $N{=}50{,}000$ synthetic examples) to contextualize the observed gains.

\begin{table}[h]

\midrule
EqualSC & 0.6005 (0.00219) & 0.6005 (0.00219) & 0.6456 (0.00214) & 0.6997 (0.00205) & 0.7595 (0.00191) \\
CARD    & 0.6005 (0.00219) & 0.6336 (0.00216) & 0.6732 (0.00210) & 0.7197 (0.00201) & 0.7730 (0.00187) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{adjustbox}
\end{table}

Observations:
- Evenâ€“odd plateaus: EqualSC exhibits expected plateaus at even $k$ due to random tie-breaking (e.g., $B{=}1$ and $B{=}2$ are equal).
- Adaptive advantage: CARD delivers consistent gains at all reported budgets by reallocating samples to maximize marginal utility and by using fractional mixing to avoid zero-gain even steps.

\section{Discussion}
Our results indicate that neuro-inspired scheduling improves mixture accuracy at fixed budgets by allocating computation where it is most needed.
This complements LLM prompting and search methods \citep{Wei2022CoT,Wang2023SelfConsistency,Yao2023ToT,Shinn2023Reflexion}, providing a unifying lens grounded in cognitive mechanisms.
Limitations include reliance on a stylized simulator rather than end-to-end language tasks; future work will integrate CARD with verification \citep{Lightman2023LetsVerify} and action \citep{Yao2023ReAct}.
We also note that the benefit of adaptive allocation depends on how conflict is estimated; richer uncertainty proxies (e.g., diversity of rationales or verifier signals) may yield larger gains.

\section{Future Work and Limitations}
- Integrate CARD with verifiers and programmatic tool-use to target compute to unverifiable segments.
- Learn better uncertainty proxies (beyond base $p$) from signals such as self-consistency diversity or rationale-level disagreement.
- Extend from majority voting to cost-sensitive decision rules balancing accuracy and latency.
- Validate on real LLM benchmarks with controlled budget constraints and ablate replay vs.\ conflict vs.\ rhythmic scheduling.
- Explore human-in-the-loop calibration: mapping subjective confidence reports to allocation policies.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented CARD, a neuro-inspired inference-time scheduler that leverages conflict monitoring, prioritized replay, and rhythmic alternation to improve reasoning under a compute budget.
Through a closed-form simulator and an allocation strategy that avoids even-step plateaus via fractional mixing, we demonstrated consistent gains over equal self-consistency at the same average budget and improved calibration.
The framework is lightweight, analytically grounded, and complementary to contemporary reasoning-and-verification approaches.
We release a fully reproducible setup and anticipate straightforward integration with verifiers, tools, and tree-search controllers.
