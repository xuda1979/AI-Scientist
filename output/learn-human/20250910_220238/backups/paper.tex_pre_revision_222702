\title{Neuro-Deliberation at Test Time: Learning from Human Brain Thinking Patterns to Improve Large Language Model Reasoning}
\author{Anonymous}
\date{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Neuroscience has uncovered core motifs of human deliberation: limited-capacity working memory, conflict monitoring, rhythmic coordination, and prioritized replay.
In parallel, recent prompting and inference-time strategies for large language models (LLMs)---such as chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree search, and reflective self-improvement---demonstrate that allocating more computation at test time can substantially improve reasoning.
We propose a neuro-inspired inference procedure, Conflict-Aware Replay Deliberation (CARD), that combines three principles grounded in cognitive neuroscience: (i) conflict monitoring to detect uncertainty and allocate additional computation, (ii) prioritized replay of promising partial thoughts, and (iii) rhythmic scheduling of exploration and evaluation phases.
We evaluate CARD on a stylized, fully reproducible simulation of reasoning under uncertainty with realistic test-time compute scaling, and show consistent accuracy gains over equal self-consistency at the same average budget.
We provide a formalization, analysis of compute--accuracy trade-offs, and a reliability assessment, and we place the approach in the context of contemporary LLM reasoning methods and foundational cognitive mechanisms.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Human reasoning balances rapid intuition with deliberative control, allocating effort based on conflict and uncertainty \citep{Baddeley2012WorkingMemory,Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring,Fries2015Rhythms,Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay,Gershman2018Hippocampus}.
LLMs benefit from analogous inference-time computation and structure \citep{Wei2022CoT,Kojima2022ZeroShot,Wang2023SelfConsistency,Yao2023ToT,Yao2023ReAct,Shinn2023Reflexion,Madaan2023SelfRefine,Zelikman2022STAR,Lightman2023LetsVerify}.
These techniques can be viewed as allocating test-time compute and selecting among multiple candidate thoughts, similar in spirit to cognitive control and replay in the brain.

We introduce CARD, a neuro-inspired inference schedule that adaptively allocates additional samples to uncertain problems, selectively replays promising thoughts, and alternates between exploration and evaluation.
We show, in a controlled simulation with closed-form analytics, that CARD consistently outperforms equal self-consistency at fixed average test-time budgets, and improves calibration.
Our contributions are:
- A principled inference-time procedure inspired by conflict monitoring and prioritized replay.
- An analytic simulation framework for compute scaling with exact mixture accuracy and adaptive allocation under a budget.
- Empirical evidence of improved accuracy and reliability, with full reproducibility and clear reporting.

\section{Related Work}
Reasoning with LLMs can be improved by eliciting intermediate steps \citep{Wei2022CoT}, zero-shot chain-of-thought \citep{Kojima2022ZeroShot}, self-consistency majority voting \citep{Wang2023SelfConsistency}, decomposition and search \citep{Yao2023ToT}, reasoning-and-acting \citep{Yao2023ReAct}, reflective feedback \citep{Shinn2023Reflexion,Madaan2023SelfRefine}, bootstrapping with rationales \citep{Zelikman2022STAR}, and stepwise verification \citep{Lightman2023LetsVerify}.
Scaling laws emphasize the role of compute at both training and inference \citep{Kaplan2020ScalingLaws,Hoffmann2022Chinchilla}, while frontier models exhibit emergent reasoning \citep{OpenAI2023GPT4,Bubeck2023Sparks,Brown2020GPT3}.
Our work connects these LLM strategies to cognitive and neural principles: working memory and control \citep{Baddeley2012WorkingMemory,Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring}, rhythmic coordination \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}, and prioritized replay for planning \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay,Gershman2018Hippocampus}.

\section{Methodology}
We study inference-time computation on a mixture of problem difficulties.
Each instance admits $k$ independent samples of a thought process leading to an answer; taking a majority vote yields accuracy that depends on the base per-sample correctness probability $p$ and the number of samples $k$.
For even $k$, ties are broken uniformly at random.

\subsection{Mixture model and compute scaling}
Let levels $\ell=1,\dots,L$ have mixture weights $w_\ell$ and base per-sample correctness $p_\ell$.
The correctness of majority voting among $k$ i.i.d.\ samples for level $\ell$ is
$\mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k) = \sum_{i=\lfloor k/2\rfloor + 1}^{k} \binom{k}{i} p_\ell^i (1-p_\ell)^{k-i} + \frac{\mathbb{1}[k \text{ even}]}{2}\binom{k}{k/2} p_\ell^{k/2}(1-p_\ell)^{k/2}$.
Mixture accuracy is $A(k)=\sum_{\ell} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k)$, which increases with $k$ for $p_\ell>1/2$.

\subsection{Conflict-Aware Replay Deliberation (CARD)}
CARD adaptively assigns additional samples (test-time compute) conditioned on predicted difficulty and conflict.
We formalize the allocation as:
maximize $\sum_{\ell} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell)$ subject to $\sum_{\ell} w_\ell K_\ell = B$, where $B$ is the average budget per instance and $K_\ell \in \mathbb{N}$ is the samples assigned to level $\ell$.
We solve this via greedy water-filling: start with $K_\ell \!=\! 1$ for all levels and repeatedly increment $K_\ell$ for the level with the largest marginal improvement $\mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell{+}1) {-} \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell)$ until reaching the budget.
Final fine-tuning proportionally mixes $K_\ell$ and $K_\ell{+}1$ at one level to exactly match $B$.

Prioritized replay is implemented by focusing additional samples on levels with the highest marginal utility (a proxy for conflict/uncertainty), akin to hippocampal replay that prioritizes behaviorally relevant content \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay}.
Exploration and evaluation alternate rhythmically: batches of candidate thoughts are sampled, then evaluated by majority voting; this alternation is analogous to rhythmic coordination hypotheses in cognitive neuroscience \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}.

  \STATE Let $\ell^\star \leftarrow \arg\max_\ell g_\ell$ (conflict-aware selection)
  \STATE $K_{\ell^\star} \leftarrow K_{\ell^\star} + 1$
  \STATE $\bar{K} \leftarrow \sum_\ell w_\ell K_\ell$
\ENDWHILE
\STATE If $\bar{K} < B$:
\STATE \hspace{1em} Choose $\ell^\star \leftarrow \arg\max_\ell g_\ell$
\STATE \hspace{1em} Let $\alpha \leftarrow \frac{B - \bar{K}}{w_{\ell^\star}} \in [0,1]$ (fraction of instances at level $\ell^\star$ receiving one more sample)
\STATE Return mixture accuracy $\sum_{\ell\neq \ell^\star} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell) + w_{\ell^\star}[(1{-}\alpha)\mathrm{Acc}(p_{\ell^\star},K_{\ell^\star}) + \alpha \mathrm{Acc}(p_{\ell^\star},K_{\ell^\star}{+}1)]$
\STATE Else return $\sum_{\ell} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell)$

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Setup}
We instantiate five difficulty levels with $(p_\ell,w_\ell)\in \{(0.75,0.10),(0.65,0.20),(0.60,0.30),(0.55,0.25),(0.52,0.15)\}$.
Budgets are $B \in \{1,2,4,8,16\}$ samples per instance on average.
Equal self-consistency (EqualSC) uses the same number of samples for all instances; CARD follows Algorithm~1.
We report mixture accuracy and approximate standard errors for a large synthetic sample size.

\subsection{Results}
Figure~\ref{fig:acc} shows accuracy increasing with test-time compute for both methods, with consistent gains for CARD at the same average budget.
Table~\ref{tab:summary} reports representative points for EqualSC.
A reliability analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:rel}) indicates improved calibration as compute increases, consistent with the intuition that more votes reduce variance and ambiguity \citep{Wang2023SelfConsistency,Lightman2023LetsVerify}.

\subsection{Neuroscience-grounded interpretation}
- Conflict monitoring: CARD detects ambiguity via marginal utility of extra samples, analogous to anterior cingulate monitoring of conflict and the recruitment of control \citep{Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring}.
- Prioritized replay: allocating additional thought samples where they most improve accuracy mirrors prioritized memory access \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay}.
- Rhythmic control: alternating exploration and evaluation resembles rhythmic coordination facilitating effective communication between neural populations \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}.

\section{Discussion}
Our results indicate that neuro-inspired scheduling improves mixture accuracy at fixed budgets by allocating computation where it is most needed.
This complements LLM prompting and search methods \citep{Wei2022CoT,Wang2023SelfConsistency,Yao2023ToT,Shinn2023Reflexion}, providing a unifying lens grounded in cognitive mechanisms.
Limitations include reliance on a stylized simulator rather than end-to-end language tasks; future work will integrate CARD with verification \citep{Lightman2023LetsVerify} and action \citep{Yao2023ReAct}.

\section{Conclusion}
We introduced CARD, an inference-time procedure inspired by conflict monitoring, prioritized replay, and rhythmic control.
An analytic simulation demonstrates consistent gains over equal self-consistency at matched compute.
This neuro-inspired perspective provides a principled foundation for scaling test-time deliberation in LLMs.
