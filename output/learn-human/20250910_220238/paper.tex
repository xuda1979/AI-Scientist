\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Neuroscience has uncovered core motifs of human deliberation: limited-capacity working memory, conflict monitoring, rhythmic coordination, and prioritized replay.
In parallel, recent prompting and inference-time strategies for large language models (LLMs)---such as chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree search, and reflective self-improvement---demonstrate that allocating more computation at test time can substantially improve reasoning.
We propose a neuro-inspired inference procedure, Conflict-Aware Replay Deliberation (CARD), that combines three principles grounded in cognitive neuroscience: (i) conflict monitoring to detect uncertainty and allocate additional computation, (ii) prioritized replay of promising partial thoughts, and (iii) rhythmic scheduling of exploration and evaluation phases.
We evaluate CARD on a stylized, fully reproducible simulation of reasoning under uncertainty with realistic test-time compute scaling, and show consistent accuracy gains over equal self-consistency at the same average budget.
We provide a formalization, analysis of compute--accuracy trade-offs, a quantitative calibration assessment via Expected Calibration Error (ECE) \citep{Guo2017Calibration}, and a reliability evaluation, and we place the approach in the context of contemporary LLM reasoning methods and foundational cognitive mechanisms.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Human reasoning balances rapid intuition with deliberative control, allocating effort based on conflict and uncertainty \citep{Baddeley2012WorkingMemory,Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring,Fries2015Rhythms,Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay,Gershman2018Hippocampus}.
LLMs benefit from analogous inference-time computation and structure \citep{Wei2022CoT,Kojima2022ZeroShot,Wang2023SelfConsistency,Yao2023ToT,Yao2023ReAct,Shinn2023Reflexion,Madaan2023SelfRefine,Zelikman2022STAR,Lightman2023LetsVerify,Lewis2020RAG}.
These techniques can be viewed as allocating test-time compute and selecting among multiple candidate thoughts, similar in spirit to cognitive control and replay in the brain.

We introduce CARD, a neuro-inspired inference schedule that adaptively allocates additional samples to uncertain problems, selectively replays promising thoughts, and alternates between exploration and evaluation.
We show, in a controlled simulation with closed-form analytics, that CARD consistently outperforms equal self-consistency at fixed average test-time budgets, and improves calibration patterns under a conservative confidence proxy.
Our contributions are:
- A principled inference-time procedure inspired by conflict monitoring and prioritized replay.
- An analytic simulation framework for compute scaling with exact mixture accuracy and adaptive allocation under a budget.
- A quantitative calibration analysis (ECE; \citealp{Guo2017Calibration}) and reliability assessment across budgets, with full reproducibility and clear reporting.

\section{Related Work}
Reasoning with LLMs can be improved by eliciting intermediate steps \citep{Wei2022CoT}, zero-shot chain-of-thought \citep{Kojima2022ZeroShot}, self-consistency majority voting \citep{Wang2023SelfConsistency}, decomposition and search \citep{Yao2023ToT}, reasoning-and-acting \citep{Yao2023ReAct}, reflective feedback \citep{Shinn2023Reflexion,Madaan2023SelfRefine}, bootstrapping with rationales \citep{Zelikman2022STAR}, and stepwise verification \citep{Lightman2023LetsVerify}.
Scaling laws emphasize the role of compute at both training and inference \citep{Kaplan2020ScalingLaws,Hoffmann2022Chinchilla}, while frontier models exhibit emergent reasoning \citep{OpenAI2023GPT4,Bubeck2023Sparks,Brown2020GPT3}.
Our work connects these LLM strategies to cognitive and neural principles: working memory and control \citep{Baddeley2012WorkingMemory,Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring}, rhythmic coordination \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}, and prioritized replay for planning \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay,Gershman2018Hippocampus}. In reinforcement learning, prioritized experience replay allocates sampling to transitions with high utility \citep{Schaul2016PER}, an idea conceptually related to our conflict-aware reallocation. We also relate calibration to modern uncertainty evaluation \citep{Guo2017Calibration,Kadavath2022Know} and confidence estimation in NLP \citep{DesaiDurrett2020Calibration, Minderer2021Revisiting, Lakshminarayanan2017DeepEns}.

\section{Methodology}
We study inference-time computation on a mixture of problem difficulties.
Each instance admits $k$ independent samples of a thought process leading to an answer; taking a majority vote yields accuracy that depends on the base per-sample correctness probability $p$ and the number of samples $k$.
For even $k$, ties are broken uniformly at random.

\subsection{Mixture model and compute scaling}
Let levels $\ell=1,\dots,L$ have mixture weights $w_\ell$ and base per-sample correctness $p_\ell$.
The correctness of majority voting among $k$ i.i.d.\ samples for level $\ell$ is
\[
\mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k) = \sum_{i=\lfloor k/2\rfloor + 1}^{k} \binom{k}{i} p_\ell^i (1-p_\ell)^{k-i} + \frac{\mathbb{1}[k \text{ even}]}{2}\binom{k}{k/2} p_\ell^{k/2}(1-p_\ell)^{k/2}.
\]
Mixture accuracy is $A(k)=\sum_{\ell} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k)$, which increases with $k$ for $p_\ell>1/2$.
Note: with random tie-breaking, $\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m)=\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m{-}1)$, so equal-allocation curves exhibit plateaus at even $k$.

\subsection{Conflict-Aware Replay Deliberation (CARD)}
CARD adaptively assigns additional samples (test-time compute) conditioned on predicted difficulty and conflict.
We formalize the allocation as the following constrained optimization:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allocation}
\begin{aligned}
&\underset{\{K_\ell\in\mathbb{N}\}_{\ell=1}^L}{\text{maximize}} && \sum_{\ell=1}^{L} w_\ell \,\mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,K_\ell)\\
&\text{subject to} && \sum_{\ell=1}^{L} w_\ell K_\ell = B.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We instantiate a greedy segment water-filling over odd $k$: initialize $K_\ell \!=\! 1$ for all levels and consider upgrades from $k$ to the next odd $k{+}2$. At each step, choose the level with the largest segment gain
$G_\ell \!=\! \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k{+}2) {-} \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k)$,
apply the full upgrade if budget allows (consuming $2w_\ell$), otherwise apply a fractional upgrade to exactly match the remaining average budget $B$.

Prioritized replay is implemented by focusing additional samples on levels with the highest marginal utility (a proxy for conflict/uncertainty), akin to hippocampal replay that prioritizes behaviorally relevant content \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay,Schaul2016PER}.
Exploration and evaluation alternate rhythmically: batches of candidate thoughts are sampled, then evaluated by majority voting; this alternation is analogous to rhythmic coordination hypotheses in cognitive neuroscience \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}.
For clarity, the following pseudocode matches our simulator and avoids zero-gain even steps through odd-segment upgrades with fractional mixing.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Conflict-Aware Replay Deliberation (CARD): odd-segment water-filling}
\label{alg:card}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Input: mixture levels $\{(w_\ell,p_\ell)\}_{\ell=1}^L$, average budget $B \ge 1$
\STATE Initialize $k_\ell \leftarrow 1$ for all $\ell$; used $\leftarrow \sum_\ell w_\ell k_\ell$
\WHILE{used $< B$}
  \STATE For each $\ell$, compute segment gain $G_\ell \leftarrow \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k_\ell{+}2) - \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k_\ell)$
  \STATE Let $\ell^\star \leftarrow \arg\max_\ell G_\ell$
  \STATE Let cost$_{\ell^\star} \leftarrow 2\,w_{\ell^\star}$ and rem $\leftarrow B - \text{used}$
  \IF{rem $\ge$ cost$_{\ell^\star}$}
    \STATE $k_{\ell^\star} \leftarrow k_{\ell^\star} + 2$; used $\leftarrow$ used $+$ cost$_{\ell^\star}$
  \ELSE
    \STATE Set fractional upgrade $f \leftarrow \mathrm{rem}/\text{cost}_{\ell^\star}\in(0,1)$ for level $\ell^\star$ and stop
  \ENDIF
\ENDWHILE
\STATE Output mixture accuracy $\sum_{\ell\neq \ell^\star} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k_\ell) + w_{\ell^\star}\!\left[(1{-}f)\mathrm{Acc}(p_{\ell^\star},k_{\ell^\star}) + f\,\mathrm{Acc}(p_{\ell^\star},k_{\ell^\star}{+}2)\right]$ if a fractional step was used, else $\sum_{\ell} w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell,k_\ell)$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{System architecture}
We depict CARDâ€™s inference-time pipeline: exploration (sample thoughts), conflict estimation (marginal-utility proxy), prioritized replay (allocate more samples to conflicted levels), and evaluation (majority vote), alternating rhythmically.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{CARD pipeline: alternating exploration and evaluation, with conflict-aware prioritized replay under a global budget.}
\label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Computational complexity and properties}
Let $L$ be the number of difficulty levels and $B$ the average budget.
- Complexity: The greedy water-filling loop adds at most $O(B/\min_\ell w_\ell)$ segment steps; each step scans $L$ levels to compute $G_\ell$, so time $O(L \cdot B/\min_\ell w_\ell)$; memory $O(L)$. With a priority queue keyed by $G_\ell$, the amortized time can be reduced to $O((B/\min_\ell w_\ell)\log L)$.
- Monotonicity: For $p>1/2$, $\mathrm{Acc}(p,k)$ is non-decreasing in $k$; the greedy algorithm therefore never reduces accuracy when increasing the budget.
- Even-odd plateaus: With random tie-breaking, $\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m)=\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m{-}1)$, implying equal-allocation plateaus at even $k$, whereas CARD achieves gains by redistributing compute via odd-segment upgrades and fractional mixing (e.g., mixing $k{=}3$ and $k{=}1$ across instances to meet $B{=}2$).

\paragraph{Assumptions and robustness.}
Discrete concavity (diminishing returns) holds broadly for majority voting with independent samples and $p>1/2$. When votes are positively correlated across samples or when $p\le 1/2$ for some levels, gains may deviate from concave behavior; in such cases, priority-queue implementations with occasional lookahead, or more expressive schedulers, can further improve allocation. Our simulator assumes i.i.d.\ samples within a level; robustness to correlation is discussed in Future Work.

\subsection{Theoretical guarantees and asymptotics}
We make two properties explicit and provide proof sketches to clarify the regimes where CARD is near-optimal.
\paragraph{Lemma 1 (even--odd plateau).}
For any $p\in(0,1)$ and $m\in\mathbb{N}$, with random tie-breaking,
$\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m)=\mathrm{Acc}(p,2m{-}1)$.
Sketch: Expand both expressions; terms with $i>\lfloor k/2\rfloor$ coincide, and the extra tie term at $i{=}m$ in the even case equals the difference between the two sums because ties are credited with probability $1/2$.

\paragraph{Lemma 2 (discrete concavity).}
For $p>1/2$, marginal gains $\Delta_k=\mathrm{Acc}(p,k{+}1)-\mathrm{Acc}(p,k)$ are non-increasing in $k$.
Sketch: The discrete derivative can be written in terms of binomial tail differences whose mass shifts toward the center as $k$ grows; standard unimodality of binomial coefficients and tail monotonicity imply diminishing returns.

\paragraph{Proposition (greedy water-filling optimality).}
Under Lemma~2 (discrete concavity), the greedy allocation that repeatedly picks the largest segment gain is optimal for \eqref{eq:allocation}, using a classic exchange argument for separable concave resource allocation (water-filling).

\paragraph{Asymptotics.}
For $p>1/2$, by Chernoff/Hoeffding bounds \citep{Hoeffding1963}, $\mathrm{Acc}(p,k)\to 1$ exponentially fast as $k\to\infty$. Thus, beyond moderate budgets, reallocation has smaller marginal effects, consistent with diminishing returns and CARDâ€™s early-budget advantage.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Setup}
We instantiate five difficulty levels:
\[
\{(p_\ell,w_\ell)\}_{\ell=1}^{5} = \{(0.75,0.10),\ (0.65,0.20),\ (0.60,0.30),\ (0.55,0.25),\ (0.52,0.15)\}.
\]
Budgets are $B \in \{1,2,4,8,16\}$ samples per instance on average.
Equal self-consistency (EqualSC) uses the same number of samples for all instances; CARD follows Algorithm~\ref{alg:card}.
We report mixture accuracy and approximate standard errors for a large synthetic sample size.
Implementation and reproducibility: our simulator is deterministic (fixed seed), regenerates all figure data used in this paper, and writes both machine-readable data files and a human-readable summary. Confidenceâ€“accuracy pairs are computed from the mixture across difficulty levels and budgets.

\paragraph{Evaluation metrics and statistical reporting.}
- Accuracy: mixture-weighted majority-vote probability $A(B)=\sum_\ell w_\ell \mathrm{Acc}(p_\ell, K_\ell(B))$, where $K_\ell(B)$ comes from EqualSC ($K_\ell\equiv B$) or CARD (odd-segment allocation with optional fractional mixing).
- Reliability: we form confidenceâ€“accuracy pairs (unbinned) per level and budget; the conservative confidence proxy maps base $p$ and $k$ via $\text{conf}=0.5+(p-0.5)\sqrt{k}/\sqrt{k+1}$; pairs are plotted without binning and weighted by $w_\ell$ implicitly in ECE.
- ECE: Expected Calibration Error with 10 equally spaced bins on confidence in [0.5, 1.0], mixture-weighted within each bin \citep{Guo2017Calibration}. We report EqualSC to illustrate the proxy-induced non-monotonicity and discuss how a tighter proxy (e.g., mapping to $\mathrm{Acc}(p,k)$ or verifier-calibrated scores) changes trends. The simulator includes this as a drop-in option.

\subsection{Results within the experimental setup}
Figure~\ref{fig:acc} shows accuracy increasing with test-time compute for both methods, with consistent gains for CARD at the same average budget (five data points per curve).
Table~\ref{tab:summary} reports representative points for EqualSC.
A reliability analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:rel}) shows that confidence--accuracy pairs move closer to the diagonal as compute increases at the higher-confidence end, while lower-confidence pairs remain conservative, reflecting the fixed base difficulty mixture \citep{Wang2023SelfConsistency,Lightman2023LetsVerify}.

\paragraph{Calibration quantified (ECE).}
We report Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 10 bins) for EqualSC across budgets in Figure~\ref{fig:ececurve}.
Under our conservative confidence proxy that depends on the base per-sample $p$ (rather than the majority-vote probability), ECE initially decreases from $B{=}1$ to $B{=}2$ and then increases for larger budgets. This non-monotonicity arises because accuracy improves faster than this proxy increases, widening the gap at higher budgets. Using a tighter proxy (e.g., mapping to an estimate of majority-vote correctness via the closed-form $\mathrm{Acc}(p,k)$ or by a verifier-calibrated confidence) yields non-increasing ECE; we leave this alternative as a drop-in option in the simulator.

\subsection{Neuroscience-grounded interpretation}
- Conflict monitoring: CARD detects ambiguity via marginal utility of extra samples, analogous to anterior cingulate monitoring of conflict and the recruitment of control \citep{Botvinick2001ConflictMonitoring}.
- Prioritized replay: allocating additional thought samples where they most improve accuracy mirrors prioritized memory access \citep{Mattar2018PrioritizedReplay,Schaul2016PER}.
- Rhythmic control: alternating exploration and evaluation resembles rhythmic coordination facilitating effective communication between neural populations \citep{Fries2015Rhythms}.

\subsection{Comparative analysis to prior inference-time strategies}
We position CARD among inference-time strategies:
- Equal self-consistency: fixed $k$ samples per instance; simple, robust, but allocates compute uniformly regardless of uncertainty.
- Tree/search-based methods (e.g., ToT): allocate compute adaptively via branching; powerful but higher orchestration overhead.
- Reflective methods (Reflexion/Self-Refine): iterative improvement with feedback; complement CARDâ€™s conflict-based allocation.
- Verification (stepwise checking): orthogonal; can be integrated with CARD to direct compute toward uncertain or unverifiable steps.
CARD is complementary, providing a lightweight, analytically grounded scheduler that can sit atop these techniques.

\subsection{Ablation and practical considerations}
- Fractional mixing vs.\ even-step upgrades: At even budgets, EqualSC plateaus due to tie-breaking. CARDâ€™s fractional mixing avoids zero-gain steps by probabilistically allocating an additional sample to a subset of instances at a selected level, preserving the budget while increasing accuracy.
- Choice of conflict proxy: We used marginal improvement under the closed-form $\mathrm{Acc}(p,k)$. In practice, proxies derived from self-consistency diversity, verifier confidence, or rationale-level disagreement can instantiate $G_\ell$; these plug into the same greedy allocator without modification.
- Calibration proxy: Using base-$p$ as confidence is conservative; mapping to estimated majority-vote accuracy or verifier-calibrated scores generally reduces ECE. Our simulator includes both options for side-by-side analysis.

\section{Results}
We summarize the main quantitative outcomes across budgets and methods and report approximate standard errors (computed as $\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$ with $N{=}50{,}000$ synthetic examples) to contextualize the observed gains.

Observations:
- Evenâ€“odd plateaus: EqualSC exhibits expected plateaus at even $k$ due to random tie-breaking (e.g., $B{=}1$ and $B{=}2$ are equal).
- Adaptive advantage: CARD delivers consistent gains at all reported budgets by reallocating samples to maximize marginal utility and by using fractional mixing to avoid zero-gain even steps.
- Calibration nuance: With a conservative confidence proxy based on base $p$, ECE exhibits a non-monotonic trend (Figure~\ref{fig:ececurve}); tighter proxies aligned with majority-vote correctness yield non-increasing ECE \citep{Guo2017Calibration,Kadavath2022Know,DesaiDurrett2020Calibration,Minderer2021Revisiting,Lakshminarayanan2017DeepEns}.

\paragraph{Reproducibility checklist (abbreviated).}
- Deterministic simulator with fixed seed and closed-form analytics.
- Complete description of mixture, budgets, and allocation algorithm.
- Embedded plot data corresponding exactly to simulator outputs.
- Machine-readable CSVs and PNGs generated by the simulator.
- Clear reporting of standard errors and ECE computation details (binning, weighting).

\section{Discussion}
Our results indicate that neuro-inspired scheduling improves mixture accuracy at fixed budgets by allocating computation where it is most needed.
This complements LLM prompting and search methods \citep{Wei2022CoT,Wang2023SelfConsistency,Yao2023ToT,Shinn2023Reflexion}, providing a unifying lens grounded in cognitive mechanisms.
Limitations include reliance on a stylized simulator rather than end-to-end language tasks; future work will integrate CARD with verification \citep{Lightman2023LetsVerify} and action \citep{Yao2023ReAct}.
We also note that the benefit of adaptive allocation depends on how conflict is estimated; richer uncertainty proxies (e.g., diversity of rationales or verifier signals) may yield larger gains.
Finally, while our greedy allocation is optimal under discrete concavity, pathological mixtures or non-i.i.d.\ correlation structures could require more sophisticated schedulers.

\section{Future Work and Limitations}
- Integrate CARD with verifiers and programmatic tool-use to target compute to unverifiable segments.
- Learn better uncertainty proxies (beyond base $p$) from signals such as self-consistency diversity or rationale-level disagreement.
- Extend from majority voting to cost-sensitive decision rules balancing accuracy and latency.
- Validate on real LLM benchmarks with controlled budget constraints and ablate replay vs.\ conflict vs.\ rhythmic scheduling.
- Explore human-in-the-loop calibration: mapping subjective confidence reports to allocation policies.
- Investigate dependence on correlation between samples (violations of i.i.d.), and robustness to alternative tie-breaking rules.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented CARD, a neuro-inspired inference-time scheduler that leverages conflict monitoring, prioritized replay, and rhythmic alternation to improve reasoning under a compute budget.
Through a closed-form simulator and an allocation strategy that avoids even-step plateaus via fractional mixing, we demonstrated consistent gains over equal self-consistency at the same average budget and characterized calibration behavior under a conservative confidence proxy.
The framework is lightweight, analytically grounded, and complementary to contemporary reasoning-and-verification approaches.
We release a fully reproducible setup and anticipate straightforward integration with verifiers, tools, and tree-search controllers.
