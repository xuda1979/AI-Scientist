 (iii) How to integrate deterministic constrained decoding with multi-fidelity backoff and bounded-latency repair while preserving an invariant across fidelity switches?
 Our contributions address these questions via: (a) a boundary locality theory and detector/manifest; (b) strict properness and exponential finite-$B$ leakage with validation; (c) a decoding loop with guards, ARA* repair, and ILP fallback under explicit TU conditions; and (d) safe OIP/PRM integration under mask dominance and KL control.
 
-\paragraph{Organization.} Section~\ref{sec:related} surveys related work. Section~\ref{sec:method} outlines the end-to-end methodology and decoding loop. Sections~\ref{sec:tokenizers}--\ref{sec:proper} develop tokenizer safety and masked training theory. Sections~\ref{sec:threat}--\ref{sec:complexity} cover the threat model, experiments, results/analysis, decoding/repair, OIP/PRM safety, and complexity. Reproducibility, limitations, broader impacts, and the Conclusion appear near the end as the final numbered section of the main body. Acknowledgments, Appendices, and References follow.

 \section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
 Constrained decoding for generation includes PICARD \cite{scholak2021picard}, constraint-driven search \cite{lu2010grid}, NeuroLogic A* \cite{lu2021neurologic}, and WFST-based decoding \cite{mohri2002weighted}. Subword tokenization with BPE/WordPiece/SentencePiece is standard \cite{sennrich2016bpe,wu2016wordpiece,kudo2018sentencepiece}, but tokenizer-aware safety is underexplored; we formalize locality and provide detectors/manifests grounded in Unicode security best practices \cite{UAX15,UTR36,UTS39,UAX31}. Strictly proper scoring rules and calibration \cite{gneiting2007scoring,guo2017calibration} motivate our masked objective and schedules. Repair builds on A* search and anytime variants \cite{hansen2007anytime} and leverages TU guarantees from combinatorial optimization \cite{schrijver1986,nemhauserwolsey1988}. Ontology-grounded and process supervision components relate to prompt/prefix tuning \cite{lester2021prompt,li2021prefix,liu2022ptuningv2} and to constrained RL \cite{achiam2017cpo,ganchev2010pr}. Our focus is a verification-first integration that emphasizes tokenizer boundaries, deterministic composition, and certifiable repair.

 \begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
-As $B\to\infty$, the masked softmax has zero mass on $I=\Sigma\setminus\mathcal{S}_t$. The loss reduces to cross-entropy on the legal simplex. With $q_t=(1-\eta)\,\delta_{y_t}+\eta\,\mathrm{Unif}(\mathcal{S}_t)$, the expected risk equals $H(q_t)+\mathrm{KL}(q_t\|\pi_t)$, minimized uniquely at $\pi_t=q_t$ by non-negativity and strict convexity of KL on the legal simplex. Taking expectation over $(x_t,y_t)$ yields the claim. A full derivation is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:proper}.

+\begin{proposition}[Weighted A* suboptimality bound]\label{prop:waa}
+Let $h$ be admissible and consistent, and let $w\ge 1$. The first solution returned by weighted A* with evaluation function $f(u)=g(u)+w\,h(u)$ has cost $g(\mathrm{sol}) \le w \cdot g^\star$, where $g^\star$ is the optimal solution cost. In ARA*, decreasing the weight sequence $w_0>w_1>\dots\to 1$ monotonically tightens this bound, and when $w=1$ the returned solution is optimal.

+\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
+Classical weighted A* analysis shows that for admissible and consistent $h$, any node $u$ on an optimal path satisfies $f(u)\le w\,g^\star$. The first solution popped must have $f \le w\,g^\star$ and $h=0$ at a goal, hence $g(\mathrm{sol})\le w\,g^\star$. ARA* inherits this bound at each fixed weight, and as $w\downarrow 1$ the bound converges to optimality; see \cite{hansen2007anytime} for details.

+- Run: execute the included Python script in this repository (the paper intentionally avoids naming files to keep the text filename-agnostic).
 - Output: The script prints a table with $B\in\{5,10,15,20,25,30,35\}$ matching Table~\ref{tab:microbench} and writes CSV files containing the same numbers. It additionally prints the analytic bound values given $K=10$, $k=3$, $\Delta=0.2$, $T=1$, $\alpha=1$.
 - Plots: The script emits a ready-to-compile pgfplots/TikZ fragment that reproduces Figure~\ref{fig:leakage_plot} (with matching axis ticks and limits) and, if matplotlib is available (optional), also saves a PNG of the same plot. This maintains the paper’s no-dependency requirement while enabling plot artifacts when desired.
 - Ablation: The script also prints a small ablation at $B=20$ with a reduced margin ($\Delta=0.1$) and writes a separate CSV for ablation results, matching Table~\ref{tab:ablation}.

 \section{Conclusion}
 We introduced OIP-CAD, a verification-first framework that unifies tokenizer-aware safety with formal locality guarantees, strictly proper masked training with explicit finite-$B$ leakage control, invariant-preserving multi-fidelity decoding, and bounded-latency repair with admissible/consistent heuristics and TU-backed ILP fallback. The micro-benchmark empirically validates the exponential leakage bound and demonstrates how to select mask budgets to meet target illegal-mass constraints across settings. Together with explicit contracts (guards, manifests, and diagnostics), these components support deterministic, auditable, and safe structured generation.

-Looking ahead, scaling the same verification-first discipline to richer grammars, more expressive transducers, and production deployments will allow us to quantify the end-to-end trade-offs between latency, accuracy, and robustness under adversarial conditions—without compromising the monotonic safety guarantees that are the core contribution of this work.

 \section{Tokenizer Locality Proof Sketch}\label{app:locality}
-We formalize greedy BPE as a rewrite system over adjacent pairs with a total order $\preceq$ on pairs. Disjoint redexes commute because they operate on disjoint substrings and do not change adjacencies within $I$. The global relation is terminating (finite merges) and locally confluent on the predicate ``contains $b$'' restricted to $I$; by Newman’s Lemma \cite{baader1998}, confluence holds, justifying the locality-based swap argument.

When tie-breaking is not guaranteed deterministic, we conservatively elevate the horizon to $L=4$ and require that the self-test validates short contexts before declaring a boundary safe.
 
 \section{Strict Properness: Detailed Derivation}\label{app:proper}
 We provide a detailed derivation that $\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{mCE}}]=H(q)+\mathrm{KL}(q\|\pi)$ on the legal simplex in the limit $B\to\infty$, and show strict convexity of the risk in $\pi$ entails uniqueness at $\pi=q$ for any $T>0$ and $\eta\in[0,1)$ under Assumption~\ref{assump:bounded}. The derivation unpacks the masked softmax support restriction and the role of label smoothing.
